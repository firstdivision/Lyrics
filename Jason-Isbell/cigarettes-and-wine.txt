                D          A
Saw her in Roosevelt Springs
             D
time doesn't touch anything
              A
she never did say she could sing
                 D
but I figured it so

I needed some company then
not sisters or children again
that's a hell of a spot to be in
but she put me in tow

Money and liquor and lust
have taken my heart and my trust
I could see ashes of dust
headed my way

She tended bar in town
her alto settled me down
so I started hanging around
didn't need much to say

D7               G
She smelled like cigarettes and wine
            D
she kept me happy all the time
                  A         A7
I know that ain't much of a line
                       D   D7
but it's the God's own truth
               G
she lives down inside of me still
                 D
rolled up like a twenty dollar bill
            A                A7
she left me alone with these pills
                   D
and the last of my youth

Wings on her shoulders and feet
a bar on Gethsemane street
I took time to plan retreat
backed out the door

I must be attracted to those 
who've witnessed a man in the throes
Of life that ain't grindstone to nose, 
but pedal to floor

D7               G
She smelled like cigarettes and wine
            D
she kept me happy all the time
                  A         A7
I know that ain't much of a line
                       D   D7
but it's the God's own truth
               G
she lives down inside of me still
                 D
rolled up like a twenty dollar bill
            A                A7
she left me alone with these pills
                  D
and my smoldering youth

Lost on the dry side of town
My memories slowing me down
She shook me and I came around
I came back to life
With nary a mother or dad
She showed me what I never had
The princess of leaves, she gets sad
'Cause I won't take a wife

D7               G
She smelled like cigarettes and wine
            D
she kept me happy all the time
                  A         A7
I know that ain't much of a line
                       D   D7
but it's the God's own truth
               G
she lives down inside of me still
                 D
rolled up like a twenty dollar bill
            A                A7
she left me alone with these pills
                   D
and the last of my youth
