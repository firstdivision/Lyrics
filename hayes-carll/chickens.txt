Blues in A > D > E

[chorus]
I got chickens in my backyard
what they do is scratch and peck
I got chickens in my backyard
what they do is scratch and peck
One of these days go out there
Find me one wring its neck

It ain't meaness y'all
It's just hungry is what I am
It ain't meaness y'all
It's just hungry is what I am
Nothin' better in this world than
Fried Chicken yes mamn

[chorus]

If it rains today
The back yard turn to mud
If it rains today
The back yard turn to mud
If it don't it won't
Either way won't rile my blood

[chorus] 2x?
