[Verse 1]

C
Wake up in the morning long and lean
Stoppin' at the corner cigarettes and gasoline
F
Pullin' down Main Street shiftin' through gears
C
Rollin' up that highway they been working on for years
G
One eye on the sunrise, one eye on the clock
F                                                     C
Come tomorrow morning, Lord I'm gonna make it back to Little Rock


[Verse 2]
  C
I searched through L.A. County the valleys and the stars
Del Rio to the bayou all them honky-tonks and bars
  F
I felt you in Seattle driving through the rain
C
Ran through New York City just a callin' out your name
      G
After all these years of searchin' I finally found my spot
F                                                   C
One way or another, Lord, I'm gonna make it down to Little Rock

[Bridge]
F
All my life I tried to find
  C
A piece of this Earth for my peace of mind
F
All these years of searchin' let my troubles disappear
G
Maybe find a place where we can sit and drink a beer

[Verse 3]
       C
Half a pack and seven hours boot up on the shelf
Singing to the radio and talkin' to myself
F
Screamin' through the forest magic on my soul
C
Ninety miles an hour on the cruise control
    G
I'm blowin' by the truckers, the grandmas and the cops
F                                                             C
"What's your hurry son?" well it's just that I'm on my way to Little Rock

[Verse 4]
C
Baby get ready trouble's on its way
Only thinkin' 'bout you every night and every day
     F
Tell all your other lovers forget about the past
      C
Ain't even gonna worry 'cus this time it's gonna last
    G
I'm comin' round the corner, ain't even gonna knock
F                                              C
Hey pretty baby, here comes your daddy down to Little Rock

[Spoken over outro]
C
Yeah, Little Rock! I'm goin' to Little Rock
             G
I may be the only one, but I'm goin'
F                            C
I ain't sleepin' on the couch!
