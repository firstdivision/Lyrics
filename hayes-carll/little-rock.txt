Little Rock

Capo 3 - when downtuned 1/2 step

------------------------------------------------

[Verse 1]

A
Wake up in the morning long and lean
Stoppin' at the corner cigarettes and gasoline
D
Pullin' down Main Street shiftin' through gears
A
Rollin' up that highway they been working on for years
E
One eye on the sunrise, one eye on the clock
D                                                     A
Come tomorrow morning, Lord I'm gonna make it back to Little Rock

[Verse 2]
  A
I searched through L.A. County the valleys and the stars
Del Rio to the bayou all them honky-tonks and bars
  D
I felt you in Seattle driving through the rain
A
Ran through New York City just a callin' out your name
      E
After all these years of searchin' I finally found my spot
D                                                   A
One way or another, Lord, I'm gonna make it down to Little Rock

[Bridge]
D
All my life I tried to find
  A
A piece of this Earth for my peace of mind
D
All these years of searchin' let my troubles disappear
E
Maybe find a place where we can sit and drink a beer

[Verse 3]
       A
Half a pack and seven hours boot up on the shelf
Singing to the radio and talkin' to myself
D
Screamin' through the forest magic on my soul
A
Ninety miles an hour on the cruise control
    E
I'm blowin' by the truckers, the grandmas and the cops
D                                                             A
"What's your hurry son?" well it's just that I'm on my way to Little Rock

[Verse 4]
A
Baby get ready trouble's on its way
Only thinkin' 'bout you every night and every day
     D
Tell all your other lovers forget about the past
      A
Ain't even gonna worry 'cus this time it's gonna last
    E
I'm comin' round the corner, ain't even gonna knock
D                                              A
Hey pretty baby, here comes your daddy down to Little Rock

[Spoken over outro]
A
Yeah, Little Rock! I'm goin' to Little Rock
             E
I may be the only one, but I'm goin'
D                            A
I ain't sleepin' on the couch!
