[Intro]

C                 F                 C
G6sus4            G7(omit5)         C
Am                G6sus4            F
C                 F                 C


[Verse]

         C                F             C
With his back against the san frisco traffic
       G7(omit5)                            C
On the bridges side that faces towards the jail
        Am     G6sus4               F
Setting out to join a demographic, 
       C                 F                  C
He hoists his first leg up over the rail.

       C                F                       C
And a phone call is made, Police cars show up quickly.
     G7(omit5)                    C
The sergeant slams his passenger door. 
          Am             G6sus4                      F
He says, Hey son why dont you talk through this with me,
     C                 F              C 
Just tell me what youre doing it for.


[Chorus]

          Am             C
Oh, its a little bit of everything, 
          Am                  Em
Its the mountains, Its the fog,
        Am               C
Its the news at six oclock,
         G7(omit5)
Its the death of my first dog,
        C                   F 
Its the angels up above me,
        C             C/B           Am 
Its the song that they dont sing,
    G7(omit5)                        C
Its a little bit of everything.


[Verse]

     C            F                 C
An older man stands in a buffet line,
       G7(omit5)                   C
He is smiling and holding out his plate,
Am              G6sus4                   F
And the further he looks back into his timeline,
      C                    F            C
That hard road always had led him to today,

             C               F                   C
And making up for when his bright future had left him,
     G7(omit5)                                 C
Making up for the fact that his only son is gone,
             Am         G6sus4                   F
And letting everything out once, His server asks him,
         C                F                       C
Have you figured out yet, what it is you want?


[Chorus]

         Am                    C
I want a little bit of everything,
     Am                  Em
The biscuits and the beans,
         Am                    C
Whatever helps me to forget about
      G6sus4              G7(omit5)
The things that brought me to my knees,
          C                     F 
So pile on those mashed potatoes,
         C      C/B        Am 
And an extra chicken wing,
G6sus4             G7(omit5)       C
Im having a little bit of everything.


[Solo]


[Verse]

            C              F                 C
Somewhere a pretty girl is writing invitations,
     G6sus4        G7(omit5)            C
To a wedding she has scheduled for the fall,
              Am       G6sus4               F
Her man says, Baby, can I make an observation?
          C                F                C
You dont seem to be having any fun at all.

                    C               F                           C
She said, You just worry about your groomsmen and your shirt-size,
        G6sus4             G7(omit5)            C
And rest assured that this is making me feel good,
            Am               G6sus4             F
I think that love is so much easier than you realize,
           C                     F                    C
If you can give yourself to someone, Then you should.


[Chorus]

            Am                       C
Cause its a little bit of everything,
            Am                  Em
The way you choke, the way you ache,
      Am                    C
It is getting up before you, 
        G6sus4              G7(omit5)
So I can watch you as you wake.
           C                     F 
So in the day in late September,
        C         C/B           Am 
Its not some stupid little ring,
            G6sus4           G7(omit5)   C
Im giving a little bit of everything.

          Am                     C
Oh, its a little bit of everything,
         Am                  Em
Its the matador and the bull,
        Am                    C
Its the suggested daily dosage,
          G6sus4             G7(omit5)
It is the red moon when its full.
          C                     F 
All these psychics and these doctors,
           C         C/B           Am 
Theyre all right and theyre all wrong,
             C                   F
It's like trying to make out every word,
                  C           Am
When they should simply hum along,
               C                   F
It's not some message written in the dark,
        C          C/B      Am
Or some truth that no one's sees,
  G6sus4             G7(omit5)   C
It's a little bit of everything.
