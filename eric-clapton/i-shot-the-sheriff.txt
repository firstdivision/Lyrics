[VERSE 1:]

C     Bm         Em
All around in my home town
C               Bm         Em
They're trying to track me down
  C                Bm             Em
They say they want to bring me in guilty
       C           Bm     Em
For the killing of a deputy
       C        Bm     Em
For the life of a deputy    But I say? (play MAIN RIFF)

[VERSE 2:]
C      Bm          Em
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
C     Bm         Em
For what I don't know
C     Bm          Em
Every time that I plant a seed
  C             Bm         Em
He said "Kill it before it grows"
  C             Bm         Em
He said "Kill it before it grows"   I say!

[VERSE 3:]
C      Bm         Em
Freedom came my way one day
C      Bm           Em
And I started out of town yeah
C        Bm           Em
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
C         Bm       Em
Aiming to shoot me down
   C   Bm    Em
So I shot, I shot him down    I say!

[VERSE 4:]
C     Bm         Em
Reflexes got the better of me
C     Bm         Em
And what is to be must be
C     Bm             Em
Every day the bucket falls to the well
C              Bm          Em
But one day the bottom will drop out
C        Bm                Em

Yes, one day the bottom will drop out   But I say
