Slaid Cleaves - Getaway Car

INTRO: G  C  G  C  G

                   C          G
The old man's been drinking
                 C         G
And momma's been driving
                            D      G
Herself home alone more and more
             C              G
Baby tugging at her breast
                   C              G
Little devil won't take no rest
            D                      G      C  G  C  G
The goddamn neighbours all keeping score

             C          G
It's momma's birthday
            C                  G
Oh, but the bills ain't paid
                       D      G
We'll sit alone in the dark
                      C                   G
"Make a pallet by the screen door, dear
                      C             G
Try and get some cool air in here"
                                 D      G
Listening to the highway rolling past

CHORUS:
      C                G       D
And I dream of a getaway car
One with no brakes or plates
Dark and swift without a trace
     C                G          D
I'll drive it, oh, so far away
Straight out into the night
          G                  C              G       C  G  C  D    G
I'm gonna bury it all in the glow of my taillights

                   C              G
Town pump's at the edge of town
                                 C              G
The whores call his name when he comes around
                                       D      G
Three sheets to the wind like a millionaire
                   C                 G
Crawls home on his hands and knees
                C                G
To three hungry mouths to feed
                 D                 G
Their bellies as empty as the Frigidaire

CHORUS:
      C                G       D
And I dream of a getaway car
One with no brakes or plates
Dark and swift without a trace
     C                G          D
I'll drive it, oh, so far away
Straight out into the night
          G                  C              G
I'm gonna bury it all in the glow of my taillights
