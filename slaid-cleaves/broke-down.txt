Broke Down


D
Sherry had a pawn shop band of gold,
A sink full of dishes and a love grown cold,
G                 A
Along came a boy, pretty as the devil,
    D        A            	Bm
She took his hand, the whole thing unravelled,
G                  A
There's no turnin' round, 
           D
It's broke down.

Billy took the ring, jammed it in his pocket,

Drove down town and tried to hock it,
G			A
Down at the bottom of Lake Ponchartrain,
	   D	    A	             Bm
There's a love not carved inside a wedding ring.
G           A
Broke down, cracked and shattered,
D        A            Bm
Left in pieces like it never even mattered,
G           A
Broke down, torn and frayed,
D               A           Bm
Ain't nothin' left you could give away,
G                  A
There's no turnin' round, 
           D
It's broke down.
G
Ain't no tellinâ€™ where love goes,
A                    D
Maybe down where the black river flows,
G                    A
Won't be comin' back round, 
           D
It's broke down.
D
Baby in the back seat, another on the way,

Sherry thinks of Billy at the end of every day,
G		    	        A
She spends her nights waiting for real life to start,
D		  A		Bm
Listening to the sound of her double crossed heart.

G	     A
Broke down, cracked and shattered, 
D	  A		Bm
Left in pieces like it never even mattered,
G		    A
There's no turnin' round,
           D
It's broke down.
D
On the other side of town, two lovers lie still,
Cigarette smokin' on a window sill,
	   G		            A
There's a picture locked up in an old suitcase,
       D	  A		Bm
Billy closes his eyes but he still sees her face.

G		A
Broke down, cracked and shattered,
D	 A		 Bm
Left in pieces like it never even mattered,
G	      A
Broke down, torn and frayed,
      D		A		Bm
Ain't nothin' left you could give away,
G	    	     A
There's no turnin' round,
      D
It's broke down.
D
Broke down.
