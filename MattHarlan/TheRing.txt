“It’s cold outside tonight babe, better wear your coat you know we can’t afford no doctor bills.”
She might as well have told him, “Jack you ain’t good for nothin’”
‘Cause he answered with his hand and left her lying still.

She married up a mean one, he don’t take no direction.
His temper leads him where he needs to go.
He has a funny way of showing his affection
And by now you might think that she might know.

The ring around her eye – all the colors in the sky
In the quiet, twilight minutes ‘fore the dawn.
Purple, black and blue with a light creeping through,
And the shadow of five fingers round her arm.

Everybody has one, you never see ’em coming,
Those unfamiliar points of no return.
Suzanne passed hers last winter, some midnight in December
One lonely hour it showed itself to her.

She was cleaning up the kitchen,
The mess she made for dinner,
Trying hard to calm her trembling hands.
It was drowning in the dishes, beneath her own reflection
A spot that won’t come clean, in a silver frying pan.

The ring around her eye – all the colors in the sky
In the quiet, twilight minutes ‘fore the dawn.
Purple, black and blue with a light creeping through,
And the shadow of five fingers round her arm.

The sirens they came blazing early that next morning.
They came because she called for them to come.
They found Jack in the bedroom, right where she said they’d find him.
Suzanne was in the kitchen having coffee with a gun.

The ring around her eye – all the colors in the sky
In the quiet, twilight minutes ‘fore the dawn.
Purple, black and blue with a light creeping through,
And the shadow of five fingers round her arm.
