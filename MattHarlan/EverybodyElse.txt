Matt Harlan - Everybody Else

C#m
There were days I grabbed a guitar strung 
E
With all my hopes & dreams, 
  B
& played until my fingers tore 
        C#m
To the fresh skin underneath. 
      A
Now, mostly I just go to work, 
   E
& practice all those ways 
   B                       Am
To be like everybody else. 


Trapped inside a window room, 
& the sun it surely shines. 
But I can't feel a single thing 
With these laptop hands & board-room eyes. 

I've been snared inside a paycheck. 
Locked inside for days. 
Scratching out a living under 
                 C#m
Someone else's name. 
 
A   
Outside there's rubber on the highway, 
   E
& fossils in the dirt. 

B
Everything that is today 
     Am
Is something we once were. 
A
Ghosts left haunting empty houses – 
B
Scaring just themselves, 
   Cdim
& finding different ways 
    C#m
To be like everbody else. 

F#m
Babe I need you more than ever 
  C#m
'Cause I can't tell how much I've grown. 
E
Compare me to your own sweet measure, 
B                   C#dim      
Graphite & wood, or hurting bones. 
F#m 
Come & find me in the twilight 
C#m
I'm sleeping but for you I'll rise. 
E
Come tear me from this dark & dreamless 
B                C#dim      C#m
World of fear & rich man's lies. 

Time jumped up & moved without me – 
Shifting all that I have known. 
Clowns run circles in the forest 
Claiming all they see their own. 

I hide under the patch work sheets, 
The warmest of the prison cells, 
& dream up all these ways to be 
Like everybody else. 

Green-eyed women circle ‘round, 
Like moths they take their turn. 
Just like me they're waiting for 
The sound of my return. 
Ghosts left haunting empty houses, 
Scaring just themselves, 
& finding different ways 
To be like everybody else. 

Babe I need you more than ever 
'Cause I can't tell how much I've grown. 
Compare me to your own sweet measure, 
Graphite & wood, or hurting bones. 
Come & find me in the twilight 
I'm sleeping but for you I'll rise. 
Like morning break this restless slumber, 
Awaken all that nests inside.
