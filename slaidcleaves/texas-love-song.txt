(G)For you, I'd give up (D)all my time, (G)searching for the (C)perfect rhyme
And (G)this is one that (D)certainly perplexes
For (G)you, I would spend (D)all my days (G)thinking up all the (C)crazy ways
I (G)love you even (D)more than I love (G)Texas

You got (G)Bellaire class and (D)Dallas style, (G)Austin soul and a (C)Luckenbach smile
For (G)you I'd trade my truck in for a (D)Lexus
You (G)smell as sweet as the (D)piney woods, I'd (G)marry you if I (C)thought I could
I (G)love you even (D)more than I love (G)Texas

(Chorus)
You're the (C)barb on my wire, the (G)spark in my campfire
There's no brighter star in (Em)all the multi-(D)plexes
You (G)know I love this state, (D)you know I do, but the (G)best thing in this (C)state is you
I (G)love you even (D)more than I love (G)Texas

Solo:  |(G) |(D) |(G) |(C) |(G) |(G) |(D) |(D) |
       |(G) |(D) |(G) |(C) |(G) |(D) |(G) |(G) |

Your (G)wit's as sharp as a (D)prickly pear, the (G)sun shines in your (C)golden hair
Your (G)smile hits me right in the solar (D)plexus
(G)Skin as soft as early (D)morning rain, (G)temper like a gulf coast (C)hurricane
I (G)love you even (D)more than I love (G)Texas

From the (G)Mucky Duck to the (D)Broken Spoke, you (G)know this state like an (C)old cowpoke
You (G)know where all the tastiest Tex-(D)Mex is
You got (G)Mattson on the (D)radio playing (G)Robert Earl and Billy (C)Joe
I (G)love you even (D)more than I love (G)Texas

(Chorus)
You're the (C)barb on my wire, the (G)spark in my campfire
Let's head out west where (Em)nobody can (D)text us
I (G)promise you I'll (D)never cheat or you can (G)throw me out in the (C)old mesquite
I (G)love you even (D)more than I love (G)Texas

(Tag)
And (G)if you make me (D)leave this state, I'll (G)curse but I won't (C)hesitate
'Cause I (G)love you even (D)more than I love (C)Texas, yodel - eee - (G)leee ----
