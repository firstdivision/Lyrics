G]                      [D]
Fall down on your knees
[D]                             [Em]
Hear the whisper through the trees
[Em]                     [C]
No one's come to save you

Let fade the little lies
The sentimental cries
Behold what nature gave you

Chorus:
[G]          [D]
All you see
        [Em]              [C]
Every love and every dream
[G]       [D]
Temporary
        [Em]                      [C]
As the morning dew will turn to steam

Battered by the years
We'll quit this vale of tears
And leave the world to turn

The voice of midnight comes
And spoken on its tongue:
Man's infinite concern

Chorus:
All you see
Every joy and every sting
Temporary
As the blooming of the rose in spring

[G]  [D]  [Em]  [C] 2x

Live well and learn to die
Soon in the dust you'll lie
With everything you know

Cruel death will not spare
The wise, the young or fair
Let us drain this cup of woe

Chorus:
All you see
Every thing and every friend
Temporary
A love you thought would never end

[G]       [D]              [Em]
Every love and every dream
            [C]                 [G]             
And every joy and every sting
        [D]
Temporary
       [Em]                       [C]
The lullaby your mother would sing
