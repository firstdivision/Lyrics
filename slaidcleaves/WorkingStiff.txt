Slaid Cleaves- Working Stiff

E                 B7                  C#m
Where do all the sailors go, when there ships don’t come in
E                         B7            A               Am
They’re all working in a five foot box, filing folders, punching clocks

What became of whats her name, she could sing like a bird                            
Someone said that she was getting out, cleaned up her mess and then she headed south, singing


E        G#            C#m         A
I always thought I would be somebody
E            G#              C#m     A
And I never thought it would come to this
    E        B7              A      Am
Now I’m just another working stiff


Where did all the day dreams go, I only know that they're gone
Just another of the things I’ve lost and now I mind my manners when I’m talking to the boss

Because I always thought I would be somebody
And I never thought it would come to this
Now I’m just another working stiff
