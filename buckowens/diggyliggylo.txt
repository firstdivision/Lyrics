CAPO: 2nd Fret/KEY: A/PLAY: G

[G] Diggy Liggy Li and Diggy Liggy Lo

Fell in love at the [D7] fais-do-do

The pop was cold and the coffee *chaud

For Diggy Liggy Li and Diggy Liggy [G] Lo.

 

Refrain:

Diggy Liggy [C] Li loved Diggy Liggy Lo

Everyone [G] knew he was her beau

No one [D7] else could ever show

So much love for Diggy Liggy [G] Lo.

 

There's a place they find romance

Where they do the Cajun dance

Steal a kiss with ev'ry chance

Show their love with ev'ry glance.

 

Refrain

 

Finally went to see her Pa

Now he's got a Pa-in-law

Moved out where the Bayou's low

Now he's got a little Diggy Liggy Lo.
