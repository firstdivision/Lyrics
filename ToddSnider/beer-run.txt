Beer Run
By Todd Snider


Chorus 1:
A                            
B double E double R-U-N, beer run
A                        E
B double E double R-U-N, beer run
A
All we need is a ten and a fiver
  D
A car, and a key, and a sober driver
A                 E     A
B double E double R-U-N beer run


A
Couple of frat guys from Abilene
      E
Drove out all night to see Robert Earl Keen
       F#m 
At the KPIG Swine and Soiree dance
          D
They wore baseball caps and khaki pants
     A                 E
They wanted cigs so to save some money
     A                         D 
They got one off a hippie that smelled kinda funny
    A                             E 
The next thing they knew they was both really hungry and
F#             B7
Pretty thirsty too


Chorus 1


They found a store with a sign said their beer was coldest
Sent in Brad 'cuz he looked the oldest
He got a case of beer and a candybar
Walked over to where them registers are
Laid his fake I.D. on the countertop
The clerk looked and turned, and looked back and stopped
He said, "Boy, I ain't callin' the cops
but I am keepin' this card
The guys took it hard


Chorus 2:
B double E double R-U-N, beer run
B double E double R-U-N, beer run
How happy we would be
If we'd have only brought a better fake ID
B double E double R-U-N beer run

We met another old hippie named Sleepy John
Claimed to be the one from the Robert Earl song
So they gave 'em their cash, he bought 'em some brews
It was a beautiful day in Santa Cruz
Feelin' so good, shoulda been a crime
Crowd was cool and the band was primed
They made it back up to their seats just in time to 
Sing with all their friends
"The road goes on forever and the party never ends"
