     D                                   C   G
It always seems to start where we left off

G                 
Tonight I’d rather stand up straight

Am

C                  D          G/C  G
Tell me what’s so bad about happy


G                             Am

Am
Apologize to you and somebody

C                  D          G/C  G
Tell me what’s so bad about happy

C                D          G/C  G
Wonder what’s so bad about happy

          C                D          G/C  G
Somebody tell me what’s so bad about happy
