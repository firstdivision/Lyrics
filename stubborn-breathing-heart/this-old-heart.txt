Stubborn Breating Heart
This Old heart

D
PINCH ME IM DREAMING
THE STARLIGHT IS GLEAMING 
OFF YOUR EYES 
          G
LIKE NEON TONIGHT
        A
AND THE SHAPE OF A SMILE
        A
FOR THE LAST LITTLE WHILE
GIVES ME HOPE 
                   D
THAT THE TWO OF US MIGHT

D
FALL CLOTHES TOGETHER
LIKE THE TASTE OF FOREVER
'AN FOR A MOMENT 
            G
GIVE UP THE FIGHT
        A
I'LL BE GLAD FOR THE COMFORT
BUT I CANT HELP BUT WONDER
HOW THE CHANCES 
              D
ARE GETING IT RIGHT

[CHORUS]
         G
THIS OLD HEART
            D
IS BOUND TO RAMBLE
              A        A7
NEVER HOLDING STILL
              D        D7
NEVER SLOWING DOWN

          G
I'LL BE A FOOL
             D  
TOO TAKE THE GAMBLE 
          A            A7
OF LOVING YOU
          D
THIS TIME AROUND
[/CHORUS]

D
WHAT AM I THINKING
YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN DRINKING
THE GLOW OF THE 
            G
SOFT SUMMER DAWN

       A
AS THE SUN KEEPS ON RISING
EACH KISS MORE SURPRISING
CAUSE THE NIGHT
                       D
AND THE STARS HAVE ALL GONE

        D
I COULD STAY TILL TOMORROW
AND PUT OFF THE SORROW
THAT WOULD FALL 
                      G
TILL THE NEXT SETTING SUN
        A
BUT MY SOUL'S GETTING RESTLESS
AND I GUESS AFTER BREAKFAST
I'LL BE LEAVING 
                    D
WHEN THE DISHES ARE DONE

[CHORUS]
         G
THIS OLD HEART
            D
IS BOUND TO RAMBLE
              A        A7
NEVER HOLDING STILL
              D        D7
NEVER SLOWING DOWN

          G
I'LL BE A FOOL
             D
TOO TAKE THE GAMBLE 
          A            A7
OF LOVING YOU
          D
THIS TIME AROUND
