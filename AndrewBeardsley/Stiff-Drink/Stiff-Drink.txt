had a beer, just aint feeling right
won't get me in jail, or get me in a fight
won't make me fall asleep somewhere I dont know
wake up in the morning wearing all my clothes

[chorus]
how many, how many have you had
how many, still feeling sad
I need a Stiff Drink
I need a Stiff Drink
I need a Stiff Drink... tonight

ordered another draft , put it on my tab
won't end up throwing up or hailing a cab
won't make me grab the microphone or start to dance
won't make me ask her if I have a chance

[chorus]

hey bartender, I'll have another pint
sure as hell won't, get shut off tonight
won't end up yelling, "The Bouncer is a Jerk"
won't end up sleeping in and calling in to work

[chorus]

another round of pitchers for me and my friends
we'll be here all night long, till the very end
won't end up on the steps talking to a girl so fine
won't buy her friends a shot or a bottle of wine

[chorus]
