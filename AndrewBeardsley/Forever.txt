Forever

Standard Tuning
Verse Chords: D A
Chorus Chrods: A D A D F G A D

thinking bout love
things left behind
thinkin bout you
thinkin bout life

and what 
was left behind
and what it was
was a waste of time

Never could appease
your restless heart
never could cease
never could start

Forever in spite
Forever in hate
Forever is a long time
Doesn't have a date

[chorus]
A little less love
A little more touch
A little less you
A little less rough
Pickin up the phone
never let it ring
Thinking bout you
Are you thinkin bout me


When you're away
and in the middle of the night
Everything's ok
Everything seems right

And then in the sun
the harsh shadow of day
I need to escape
I wanna run away

[chorus]

[bridge]
Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
You never really know
You're gonna have to choose

[solo]

[chorus]

[outro]
