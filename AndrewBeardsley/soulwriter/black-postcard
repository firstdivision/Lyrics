Black postcard
Downtuned 1/2, capo 2

C#m intro

        C#m
I got a black postcard in the middle of the night
   E
it arrived untimed, was out of sight
          B         C#m
I was sleeping, and dreaming, 

Like ships, with two black sails
Rough seas, or so it goes
So they say, so I know

And I know, it just another dream
And I think, it might be only me
One by land, or two by sea

[CHORUS]
A            E
Sail away my friend
B                  C#m
   Do whatever you can
A            E
Navigate and steer,
B                 C#m
Stay clear of the past


A call in the night, letter by mail
Electronic, just as well
might as well, be nothing

She is gone, the time is past
I’m writing again, once at last
they all think that they know what I’m thinking

[chorus]

There’s rocks ahead, and behind
we always think in our mind
it makes the path ahead
so confusing

Did I choose right should I stay the path?
Or Am I on the line at last?
Or should I do something 
something different

[chorus]
