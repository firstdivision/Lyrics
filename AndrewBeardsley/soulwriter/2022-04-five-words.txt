This is not a love song
it's just information
its was not my intention
of doing you wrong

At the risk of exclusion
from a club such as this
I've got no excuses
For the State that I'm in

I'll seek absolution
with great emphasis
so please don't dismiss this
as nothing but words

I mean it this time
I'll not do it again
Have faith in this man
I cannot tell a lie (maybe / alternate: I'll not tell more lies)

I need another chance to!
To prove that I mean it
I'll fully commit
And go to bat for you

Can I have your vote and a nod
on election day
plaease don't send me away
back to a regular job
