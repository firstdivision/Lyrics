SHOW UP FOR THE FIGHT
-----------------------------

[VERSE 1] 
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN WE FOUGHT TOGETHER
YOU SAID YOU'D STAND WITH US FOREVER
WE MADE A VAILIENT STAND AGAINST THEM
AND WE WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN


[CHORUS 1]
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY SINCE THEN
IF YOU DO THEN YOU ARE STILL WELCOME 
WE WILL FIGHT STRONGLY
AGAINST THINGS THAT WE FIND WRONG

[VERSE 2]
WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE FEELING DOWN
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE AROUND
TO GIVE SUPPORT WHERE IT IS NEEDED
BECAUSE SOME DAY WE WILL NEED IT

[CHORUS 2]
PAY IT FORWARD THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
TOMORROW YOU FOR ME TODAY
SOME DAY I MIGHT COME CALLING
TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

[BRIDGE]
