Lyrics:

Dearly Departed
-----------------------------------------------------
Have you forgotten your dreams of late
how much you cared in the dawn of day
Have you woken up and seen the sun
have you always been on the run

with sunshine and sunsets
is golden glow that shows
we walk along dark streets
and sow our own rows

[chorus]
dearly, departed
where have you gone
dearly, departed
i miss you now

[inst]

On the path of the unknown
is where you were thrown
out of my sight to see
out of touch to me

death has a strict conviction
though we do not like to mention
a contract we all signed
watch the passing of time

[chorus]

[inst outro]
