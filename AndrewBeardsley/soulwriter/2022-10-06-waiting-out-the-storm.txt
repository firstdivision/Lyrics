-- WAITING OUT THE STORM --

A
I'VE BEEN HERE EVERY DAY
A
AT THIS SAME OLD PLACE
                       E
I'VE GOT NOTHING BUT YOU

E
IT'S BEEN TEN LONG YEARS
E
THAT I'VE STAYED RIGHT HERE
               A
HAD TO MAKE IT THROUGH

A
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT A LONG TIME AGO
A
THIS I SURELY KNOW
         E
THIS IS TRUE
E
BUT I'M NOT A LEAVER
E
NOR A DECIEVER
              A
JUST LIKE THE VIEW


WAITING OUT THE STORM
GONNA HUNCKER DOWN
