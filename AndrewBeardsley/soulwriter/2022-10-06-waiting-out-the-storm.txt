DOWN TUNE 1/2 STEP
CAPO 2

-- WAITING OUT THE STORM --

[VERSE 1]
A
I'VE BEEN HERE EVERY DAY
A
AT THIS SAME OLD PLACE
                       E
I'VE GOT NOTHING BUT YOU

E
IT'S BEEN TEN LONG YEARS
E
THAT I'VE STAYED RIGHT HERE
               A
HAD TO MAKE IT THROUGH

A
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT A LONG TIME AGO
A
THIS I SURELY KNOW
         E
THIS IS TRUE
E
BUT I'M NOT A LEAVER
E
NOR A DECIEVER
              A
JUST LIKE THE VIEW

[CHORUS]
A
WAITING OUT THE STORM
A/G
GONNA HUNCKER DOWN
        D/F#
IF IT'S ONE THING THAT I'M GOOD AT
F                E
 IT'S STAYING AROUND
 
BEING TOO SCARED TO LEAVE
TOO SCARED TO GO
STAYING PUT
IS MOSTLY WHAT I KNOW

[/CHORUS]
