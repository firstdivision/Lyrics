CAPO 2

-- WAITING OUT THE STORM --

[VERSE 1]
A
I'VE BEEN HERE EVERY DAY
A
AT THIS SAME OLD PLACE
                       E
I'VE GOT NOTHING BUT YOU

E
IT'S BEEN TEN LONG YEARS
E
THAT I'VE STAYED RIGHT HERE
               A
HAD TO MAKE IT THROUGH

A
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT A LONG TIME AGO
A
THIS I SURELY KNOW
         E
THIS IS TRUE

E
BUT I'M NOT A LEAVER
E
NOR A DECIEVER
              A    A7
I LIKE THE VIEW

[CHORUS]
D
WAITING OUT THE STORM
Bm
GONNA HUNCKER DOWN
        Gbar
IF IT'S ONE THING THAT I'M GOOD AT
E
 IT'S STAYING AROUND, BEING
A
TOO SCARED TO LEAVE
A/G
TOO SCARED TO GO
D/F#
STAYING PUT
    F             E
IS MOSTLY WHAT I KNOW

[/CHORUS]
