Capo 5

           E
Something new
          A
Something blue
             E
Maybe new to me
             B7
Maybe old to you

           E
Something pure
                 A
That's what I've seen
              E
But I've seen you
B7                  E
      Have you seen me

       A
I see blue skies
            E
and endless fields
             E
I feel their touch
               B7
my breath they steal

             E
I hear your song
                A
In the dark of night
         E
With no distractions
B7                    E
        Your voice is bright
