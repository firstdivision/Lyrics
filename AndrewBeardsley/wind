Thunder in the distance
is subsistance
makes me unwind
forget my tangles behind

one more time why not
the sailor's knot
look to the sky
one more time

wind at my back
like the southern tack
from west to east
the sailor's beast

the cross southern type
is a loss we'll see
sail to the 
southern sea

I'll come back
set sails free
downwind on a broad reach
jib and main, correct leach

hit the rudder and wheel
keep the course and steer
the crew is sleeping
and trust in us is real

the watch
Sail
Real, get the feel

Turn towards the Island
Blue water we'll bless it
Let's set sail again
