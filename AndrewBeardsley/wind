Thunder in the distance
is subsistance
makes me unwind
forget my tangles behind

one more time why not
tie the sailor's knot
look into the sky
just one more time

the wind at my back
like the southern tack
from west to east
it's the sailor's beast

the cross of southern type
is quite a special kind
is a loss we'll see
into the southern sea

I'll come back
set sails free
downwind on a broad reach
jib and main, correct the leach

hit the rudder and wheel
keep the course and steer
the crew is sleeping
trust in me they are keeping

[solo]

[repeat 2x]
Turn towards the Island
Blue water we'll bless it
Let's set sail again
never forget it
