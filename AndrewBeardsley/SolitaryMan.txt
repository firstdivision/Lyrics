C
Got my first allergy
Am
Somethin bad happend to me
F                         G
      I think you'll understand

Makin dinner for one
Lord knows it aint no fun
Drinkin my beer all alone

[CHORUS]
I never thought I'd see
A place where I would be

I'm doin' the best I can
As a solitary man

Footsteps sound loud
When you're the only one around
And the fridge just won't quit

Thunderstorms are much less fun
When you're the lonely one
Countin' down the time


[CHORUS]
I never thought I'd see
A place where I would be

I'm doin' the best I can
As a solitary man

[INST]
 
I got a garbage can
I got pots and pans
One of everything

I got a ceiling fan
For a solitary man
None of which I need


[END CHORUS]
I never thought I'd see
A place where I would be

I'm doin' the best I can
I'm doin' what I can
I'm doin' all I can
As a solitary Man
