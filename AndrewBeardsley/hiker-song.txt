Ten more miles until the next shelter
Legs are burning pack feelin' heavier
Finish this segment, then I get rest
Climb this mountain, gonna be a test
I'm hiking

Air is getting cold, the night is approaching
A fire would be nice but darkness is broaching
Lay down to rest, get up early
20 more miles, the next day we'll see
I'm Hiking
Yeah I'm hiking

Was that a dog or was it a bear?
Either way gonna get outta here
Don't want to pretend, don't wanna be a faker
I thought I saw a bear, I need more toilet paper

This food is cold, as cold as you
Lost my stove, lost my fuel
Eatin all my dry goods, diggin down deep
Lookin at the map, I think I see a street
