I was down in Houston
For two days a week
They put me up in hotels
All expense paid

So I found myself in fancy
Strange art on the walls
Even in the elevators
It was too much

So I got to my room
And was feeling restless
I'm in a town
Let's investigate this

So I looked up some places
honky tonks in town
Where can a man go
just to get down

I found one that looked right
And I called up and uber
Ten minutes and streets lights
Suddenly I was there

I think she was waiting
schoolteacher or such
she asked me to dance
I said I don't have much

but we danced together
In front of the band
She said you're not bad
at taking my hand

So we left the dance floor
for pool tables in back
We ordered more drinks
Coke and Jack

That's when it got weird
She said "call me babe"
"In front of that other guy"
I became afraid

I didn't want to die
in a Houston gunfight
So I snuck out the back
Left them two to fight

Got back to my hotel
Realized it was late
Did I just cheat death
or make a mistake
