You can’t leave me alone

in a house full of booze

and not expect me to drink it


The vodka’s on the door

The ice is very nice

Soda’s flat but I’ll take it


My cup runeth over

I lost my four leaf clover

My hands are wet my lips are not


I’m feeling kind of slow

a drifting country joe

I think I’ll do another shot


[chorus]

you can’t take me out

But don’t leave me in

I’ve been known on a time or two

To have a little Gin

I saw you at the bar

And I knew my greatest fear

I knew that there was no way

I’d get you over here

[/chorus]


[inst]


I’m drinkin in my home

Textin’ on the phone

I knew that I shouldn’t but I did


Facebook and the twitter    <— sing all three lines as one long sentence

social network no hitter

shoulda taken that advice and left the grid


I pick up my guitar

wish I had a whammy bar

I don’t so six’ll have to make do


Brought out a pen and paper

couldn’t find my eraser

pretending’ that I’m playin’ in front of you


[chorus]

[outro instro]
