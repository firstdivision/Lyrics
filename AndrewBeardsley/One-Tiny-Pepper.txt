c
One tiny pepper just sitting on a shelf
one tiny pepper all by itself
G
all dressed up in red and green
   C
nowhere to go, just wants to be seen

One tiny pepper got so much spice
one tiny pepper a slice of life
saving up all the summer long
so much heat just can’t be wrong


[chorus]
F               G             C
   Saving up in life can’t be wrong
F                  G                   C
Don’t be afraid of winter, it won’t be long
F                 G
  Send your roots deep
         C          Am
Find the water down below
       F
In the spring
    G                C
the sun will shine again
