    E
The last time that I saw you
     Bsus
They told me you were crying
      C#sus
I was holding your hand
   Abar
As you were slowly dying
    E
And I
Bsus   E
I love you

I remember when you asked me
Would you write me a song?
I said I surely would
It won't take me long
And I
I love you

I sat right down and wrote
things that I loved about my mom
from french toast and stories
that go on too long
And I
I love you


[chorus]
Asus
And I.....

    E
I'm sorry I didn't call
Asus
Each and every day
    E
I'm sorry I didn't fly back
      Bsus
Every holiday
      E
I was making a new life
          Asus
Or trying hard as I can
      E
And I know that you're not angry
  Bsus                     Asus
I know you understand

[verse]
But it doesn't stop the pain
And the guilt that I feel
It's going to take more time
Before I fully heal
And I
Will always love you

[verse]
So just tell me if you can
when you get the chance
tell me that you're happy
and that we'll meet again
And I
Will always love you

[verse]
I thought we'd have more time
We always think that we do
But life has a way
of marching us through
And I
Will always love you
