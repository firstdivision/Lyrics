[chorus]
Asus  E  Asus  Bsus

The last time that I saw you
They told me you were crying
I was holding your hand
As you were slowly dying

And I
I love you

I remember when you asked me
Would you write me a song?
I said I surely would
It won't take me long

And I
I love you

[chorus]
Asus
And I.....

    E
I'm sorry I didn't call
Asus
Every single day
    E
I'm sorry I didn't fly back
      Bsus
Every holiday
      E
I was making a new life
          Asus
Or trying as hard as I can
      E
And I know that you're not angry
     Bsus
I know you understand

But it doesn't stop the pain
And the guilt that I feel
It's going to take more time
Before I fully heal

So just tell me if you can
when you get the chance
tell me that you're happy
and that we'll meet again
    
    Asus
And I....Will always
     E
Love you
