Capo 5

Something new
Something blue
Maybe new to me
Maybe old to you

Something pure
That's what I've seen
But I've seen you
Have you seen me

I see blue skies
and endless fields
I feel their touch
my breath they steal

I hear your song
In the dark of night
With no distractions
Your voice is bright
