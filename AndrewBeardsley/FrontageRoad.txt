G   D   C

[chorus]
Get me off this frontage road
I wanna be on the highway
There's too many stoplights
I need to be in a faster lane

Stop and go and stop again
Would be better if I had a friend
Someone to pass the time
Laughin, jokin' and bouncing rhymes

Navigator runnin' radio
Someone else who hates goin' slow
Help me find the fast-food joint
Get my shades when the sun's too bright

[chorus]
Get me off this frontage road
Need to be on the highway
There's too many stoplights
gettin' in my way

Seems like it's time to stop for gas
Stretch my back and scratch my ass
A Gatorade and a bag of chips
Pick out a couple scratch tickets

Use the bathroom carefully
Make sure I don't touch anything
Wash my hands and head outside
Time to leave this dump behind

[bridge]  C   G   C    D
Full tank and pedal to the floor
Four wheel slide out onto the road
Nuthin' in the rearview 'cept a cloud of smoke
When the engine hits seven it's such a sweet note

[inst on normal chords]

Driving back from Houston, 
a long hard week of work
My truck don't like this heat, 
she's starting to buck and jerk

If I can get back on that Interstate,
and let the engine wind
I'll be a my sweetheart's house, 
in just a lick of time.

[chorus]
Get me off this frontage road
I need to get home soon
I need to see you
Ahhhh you know it's true
