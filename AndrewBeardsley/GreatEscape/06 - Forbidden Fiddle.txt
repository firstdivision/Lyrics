wore out strings, know broken dreams,
empty glasses know broken hearts
like a forest bereft of all streams,
they dont like to be apart

give it some time,
let nature take hold.
forests 'r like hearts,
they like to grow old

and he played the fiddle
while she would dance
short skirt twirled 'round corduroy pants.

old age, new age,
we'll meet in the middle
singing the song of forbidden fiddle

old rusty dinghy,
brand new cell phone
best thing about
those they always see you home

he rows his boat
like she goes to the store
buyin' brand new clothes
she can't afford

and he played the fiddle
while she would dance
short skirt twirled 'round corduroy pants.

old age, new age,
we'll meet in the middle
Singing the song of forbidden fiddle
