Verse: G   D   C   D

Chorus: C  D  G  D/F#  Em  C  D  G  D

I'm sittin' in a 10 by 12
a laptop and a Christmas elf
someone bought
at the secret holiday swap

empty suits with big old thighs
professional girls with awkward eyes
a notepad full of scribbles
and an email with no reply

[chorus]
C     D
met a senorita
         G  D/F#  Em
and I'm going to meet her
       C        D                  G     D
that's how I'm planning the great escape

una chica bonita
la cerveza mas fina
that's how I'm planning my great escape

and I’m only here today
because I need to get paid
Thinking 'bout college days
And mistakes I now wish I had made

didn't think it would end like this
with a big old laundry list
of things I
have yet to do

[chorus]

the cubicle takes its toll
on the life of a working soul
and wallpaper reminds me
where I’d like to be

cant open these window blinds
afraid there's something I might find
beyond these four
semi permanent walls
