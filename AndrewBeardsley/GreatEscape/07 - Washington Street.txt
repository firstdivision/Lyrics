I've been on the road so long
I probably shouldn't drive
cruise control's on 65
and I finally feel alive

I watched the morning sunrise
in a backwoods country dive
pancakes on paper plates
gave the waitress a five

truckers like to sleep
on the shoulder of the road
if I never left that town
I guess I'd never know

time to hit the road again
and see another mile
the fast-food joints are easy
and the girls always smile
