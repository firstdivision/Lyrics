Guitar down 1/2 Step
E A B7 
Blusey-Country feel  3/4 Walkz

First vocal note is the 5th of E (B).

E  
It's cold here for Austin
      A
Seventeen and it's awesome
E
Colder than it's been
                 B7
in quite a long while

     E
Even now that the sun's up
     A
The bulb hasn't moved much
      E
It's not expected to 
B7              E
which makes me smile

I put on my slippers
and drink four or five nippers
Make a pot coffee
Hot and real strong

Now I'm feeling real special
Like a captain and his vessel
And I can't conceive of
anything I've done wrong

(E7 lead in)
[CHORUS]
A
She's still in bed
       E
She's mad at me
Just because
                     B7
I won't turn up the heat
           E
I probably messed up real major
       A
But I know I'm in no danger
    E
As long as I can keep her
B7            E
wrapped up in sheets

She's been there all morning
Pissin' and moanin'
Yellin' for me
from her comforter cave

But I'm quite content
To listen to her rant
Because I know she can't
Make her way to me

She might be stuck there for good
In her delusional sainthood
Unless she rolls out
and gets herself dressed

If that were to happen
I'd be a dead man
But for now I think
I'm fairly safe

[CHORUS]
