Guitar down 1/2 Step
E A B7 
Blusey-Country feel

It's cold here for Austin
Seventeen and it's awesome
Colder than it's been
in quite a long while

Even now that the sun's up
The bulb hasn't moved much
It's not expected to 
which makes me smile

I put on my slippers
and drink four or five nippers
Make a pot coffee
Hot and real strong

Now I'm feeling real special
Like a captain and his vessel
And I can't conceive of
anything I've done wrong

[CHORUS]
She's still in bed
She's mad at me
Just because
I won't turn up the heat
I probably messed up real major
But I know I'm in no danger
As long as I can keep her
wrapped up in sheets

She's been there all morning
Pissin' and moanin'
Yellin' for me
from her comforter cave

But I'm quite content
To listen to her rant
Because I know she can't
Make her way to me

She might be stuck there for good
In her delusional sainthood
Unless she rolls out
and gets herself dressed

If that were to happen
I'd be a dead man
But for now I think
I'm fairly safe

[CHORUS]
