capo 5
Em A  Bsus-ish

Em has a flourish on 3rd frets of G B and E strings

We were dancin' and romancin'
and pickin' up pretty girls
least that the story we tell ourselves
in our made up drunken world

It was well past 4am
Waty past shoulda gone to sleep
Be careful who you tell your stories to
And the hours that you keep
