capo 5
Em A  Bsus-ish

Em has a flourish on 3rd frets of G B and E strings



     Em                      A
Like Kings and Queens we're royalty
       Em                A
Jewel crowns and golden curls
Em                       A
least that the story we tell ourselves
       B                Em
in our made up drunken world

If it's well past way too late
And way past shoulda gone to sleep
Be careful who you tell your stories to
And the hours that you keep






ALternates:

         Em          A
We were dancin' and romancin'
    Em                A
and pickin' up pretty girls
