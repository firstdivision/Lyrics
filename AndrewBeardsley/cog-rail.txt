Capo 1 if downtuned 1/2 step

G  D  C


Here's a song about a Cog Train

     G
Well up in new Hampsire
          D
There's a train that'll take you
       C
To the top of the mountain
    G
and back to the station
                     D
they'll take you're money my friend
            C
and that's all

if a train need gears
well I'm here to say
probably shouldn't be on it anyway
I've seen a couple transmissions go
and the ground was flat!

So what's going to happen 
when those brakes fail
and the kids are screaming
and the conductor bails
where's the fun is that, anyhow?

[chorus]
And that damn thing is way too slow
bring it to the top
and down you go
what kind of name is "Cog" anyhow?

     G
Now some people drive
    D
and some people hike
    C                G
and some people even take their bikes

   G                 D      C         G
I've done that a few times myself

    G
You get to the top 
             D
and then you buy a sticker
        C
and you put it on your car
        G (hold)
and you think you're bigger

(from hold g)
You know your car did all the work!

Now I don't care if your damn car made it
I climbed it myself inebriated
Where's the sticker for that!

[chorus]
And your damn car is way too slow
bring it to the top
and down you go
what kind of name is "Prius" anyhow?

[chorus]
Damn flatlanders are way to slow
come up for the weekend and then down you go
what kind of name is Rhode Island anyhow?

[chorus]
And that damn thing is way to slow
bring it to the top and down you go
What kind of name is "Cog" anyhow?
Yeah, what kind of name is "Cog" anyhow?
