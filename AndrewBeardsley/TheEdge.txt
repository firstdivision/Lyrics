G                C
One more nail
D                            G
One more nail and they'll be gone

G                             C
Driving though that wall, and
              D                     G
They never knew, they never saw it comin'

[CHORUS]
F                    G
Oh they couldn't get out of the way
F                  G
Oh they could not stay

Ohhhhhhhh


C      D  D    G
C      D  D    G



G 
Oh They're singing

C               D             G
   Singing that same old song again


       C           D

G
    Why would they do that? 
C                       D
    Don't they ever get tired of 
G                                
hearing those same old songs

       C          D


G                                  C
   I can tell you they don't, well maybe
            D                      G
but they're playin' them all night long

     C            D


G                C            D
lookin' out into black nothingness
G                            C
they can't tell if anyone is listenin'
D                   G
  oh but still they play

    C           D

G             C            D
hangin' on

[CHORUS]
F                    G
Oh they couldn't get out of the way
F                  G
Oh they could not stay


C      D  D    G
C      D  D    G


G             C        D
They practice, They practice them old songs

G             C         D

G                               
     Just so they can play and have 
C                       D           G
   you sittin' there and not listen on


G             C           D

G 
   They do it for you
     C         D
They do it for me 
         G
All the time



[CHORUS]
F                    G
Oh they couldn't get out of the way
F                  G
Oh they could not stay

The end of the night
C                    D              G
     They look out in that old tip jar

C                   D

G                   C           D
A couple ones, and      maybe a five
          G
if they're lucky


C           D

           G
That was from Chucky (spoken)

G
Pack up that car
     C            D
and put it all away
            G
and go back to that bar
                   C           D
maybe for one last drink

G 
And they never know, 
               C  
They might not ask
D                 G
    how many were listenin'


           G
And they play that same old song
C                 D
playin' it all
          G
all night long



           G
And they play that same old song
C                 D
playin' it all
          G
all night long
