== verse ==
C
I got a fire goin;

         E7
And it's burning my soul

         Am
Just to wonder 

    F         C
Are you still alone

And if you are
Have you travelled far
Do you keep me
in your memories

== chorus ==
    A7
And I still think of
D7
you from time to time
F                         C
Have you been thinking of me

If I could find you
I'd ask you myself
I searched high and low but you're gone















It seems that we drifted
farther away


It's been forever
at least that's how it feels
would you stll remember me?  (remember me goes up notes)
