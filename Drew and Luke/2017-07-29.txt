This American dream
that y'all been living 
ain't the bullshit hand me diwn
that I've been given

Got the ped o philiac living next-door
and the gal downstairs 
is a first class whore

The painter's face 
is the one that shows what's real
Digging in and showing
beneath what you feel

The layers underneath 
the canvas
shows what's real
Whatever
Let's go there
