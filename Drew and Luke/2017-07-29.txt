This American dream
that y'all been living 
ain't the bullshit hand me down
that I've been given

Got the ped o philiac living next-door
and the gal downstairs 
is a first class whore
and no one cares

[CHORUS]
The painter's face 
is the one that shows what's real
Digging in and showing
beneath what you feel

The layers underneath 
the canvas
shows what's real
Whatever, l et's go there
