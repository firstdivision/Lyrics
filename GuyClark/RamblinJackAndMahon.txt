Old Ramblin' Jack Elliot said:
             A                                                            D
"I got these lines in my face trying to straighten out the wrinkles in my life
       E                                                                     
When I think of all the fools I've been it's a wonder that I've sailed this many

miles

To which Larry Mahan replied
              A                                                    D
He said, "The sweet bird of youth Was sittin' on my shoulder yesterday
          E                                                             A          
But she's always changin' partners, And I always knew she'd up and fly away"


Chorus:

Staying up all night in the Driscoll Hotel

Ramblin' Jack and Mahan, was cowboyed all to hell
D
And the room smelled like bulls, the words sound like songs
     E                                                      A
Now, there's a pair to draw to, boys, I would not steer you wrong


Soooo, Ol' Ramblin' Jack said:
He said, "I recall a time I'd set my soul on fire just for show
All it ever taught me was the more I learn, the less I seem to know".
Mahan crawled out from behind a couch and said:
"Jack, as far as I can see, mistakes are only horses in disguise
Ain't no need to ride 'em over 'cause we could not ride 'em different if we tried

Chorus
