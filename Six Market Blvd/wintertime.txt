G C D E

In the wintertime
I lie to watch the snow fall
through the afterglow of summer
come to an and

Now the end of the night I never know
for how far
but I wish that it could
be back in your arms again

[CHORUS]
Cause in the Wintertime
everyone should be so in love
ain't no room for the lonely
just only the hearts
that can't get enough

and there's no more lonely nights
and there's no more tears to cry
in the wintertime
only in the wintertime
[CHORUS]

When the evening comes
a cool breeze brings me peace oif mind
and a couplke I see walkin
down the street
and the smell od coffee
and a yellow rooms
is another place in time
but I'd give anything right now
that's where I could be

[CHORUS]

[INST]

[CHORUS]

[REPEAT second half chrorus]
