Intro
Am D  G (repeat 2x)

G
In the wintertime
   C                G
I like to watch the snow fall
        G             C
for the afterglow of summer
           D/F#
come to an end

         G                  C
Now the end of the night I never know
    G
for how far
       G
but I wish that it could be 
D                  G     G7
back in your arms again

[CHORUS]
               C
Cause in the Wintertime
                    G
everyone should be so in love
          D/F#
ain't no room for the lonely
       C
just only the hearts
             G
that can't get enough

                    C
and there's no more lonely nights
                    G     D/F#   Em
and there's no more tears  to   cry
        Am              
in the wintertime
D               G
    only in the wintertime
[CHORUS]

          G
When the evening comes
   C
a cool breeze brings me 
G
peace of mind
      G            C
and a couple I see walkin
          D/F#
down the street
        G
and the smell of coffee
       C
and a yellow rose
           G
is another place in time
               G
but I'd give anything 
     D/F#
right now that's 
        G
where I could be
