Yeah

It goes away.

G#              E          F#    G#          E F#
All of this and more of no-thing in my life.

G#  E F#
No

G#          E F#
Color clay.

G#   E    F#  G#           E F#
Indi-vidu-ali-ty not safe.

[Half Chorus:]

As of now I beg you got me wrong.

D     F     C#       Amaj          G# E F# G# E F#
So unsure you run from something strong.

[Verse Two:]

G#  E F#
I

G#             E F#
Can't let go.

G#         E        F# G#            E F#
Threadbare tapestry un-winding slow.

G#   E F#
Feel

G#                E F#
A tortured brain.

G#        E          F#  G#          E F#
Show your belly like you want me to.

As of now I beg you got me wrong.

So unsure you run from something strooooooong.

          E         F#         A
I haven't felt like this in so long.

E    F#     A
Wroooooooong.

     E              F#        A
In a sense, too far gone from love.

F#                 A(hold)
That won't last for-ever.

                           G#    E F#  G# E F# 
Something's gotta turn out right.

Verse Three:

G#  E F#
You

G#            E F#
Sugar taste.

G#        E          F#  G#             E F#
Sweetness doesn't of-ten touch my face.

G#    E F#
Stay

G#              E F#
If you please.

G#      E      F#   G#             E F#
You may not be here when I leave.

[Chorus again:]

D     F     C#      Amaj       G# E F# G# E F#
As of now I beg you got me wrong.

D    F        C#       Amaj      E   F#  A
So unsure you run from something strooooooong.

In a sense, too far gone from love.
