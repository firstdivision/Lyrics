Intro]

 

G#   E F#
Yeah

   G#         E F#
It goes away.

G#              E          F#    G#          E F#
All of this and more of no-thing in my life.

G#  E F#
No

G#          E F#
Color clay.

G#   E    F#  G#           E F#
Indi-vidu-ali-ty not safe.

[Half Chorus:]

D     F      C#      Amaj       G# E F# G# E F#
As of now I beg you got me wrong.

D     F     C#       Amaj          G# E F# G# E F#
So unsure you run from something strong.

[Verse Two:]


I
Can't let go.
Threadbare tapestry un-winding slow.

Feel
A tortured brain.
Show your belly like you want me to.

[Chorus]

D      F    C#      Amaj        G# E F# G# E F#
As of now I beg you got me wrong.

D   F         C#       Amaj   E    F#     A
So unsure you run from something strooooooong.

          E         F#         A
I haven't felt like this in so long.

E    F#     A
Wroooooooong.

     E              F#        A
In a sense, too far gone from love.

F#                 A(hold)
That won't last for-ever.

                           G#    E F#  G# E F# 
Something's gotta turn out right.

Verse Three:

You
Sugar taste.
Sweetness doesn't of-ten touch my face.

Stay
If you please.
You may not be here when I leave.

[Chorus again:]

As of now I beg you got me wrong.
So unsure you run from something strooooooong.
I haven't felt like this in so long.
Wroooooooong.
In a sense, too far gone from love.
strooooooong.
I haven't felt like this in so long.
Wroooooooong.
In a sense, too far gone from love.
That won't last for-ever
Something's gotta turn out right.
