                           G      Am
I took that young thing to dinner
                        G     Am
Yeah, the one you don't like
                  G      Am 
We got nothing in common
                    G     Am
But she'll do for tonight
                           G         Am
Cause it gets cold in this big house
                       G  Am
And the winters coming on
                  D
I might need some help
                        C
To try and weather this storm


Chorus:
                   G 
I only want what I can't have
                   Em
I only miss what's gone
                D 
That guitar you gave me
          C
I lost in pawn
                  G 
Am I just like my father
                  Em
Am I just like my mom
                D 
Will I end up a drunk
               C     
Will I end up alone


Yeah I got some songs about you
But who said that 
Well I think I'd remember
Saying "this one's for Kat"
Well, I know I've gotten skinny
And I know I'm getting pale
But If I look homeless
I've been living in Hell

Chorus

I can't talk to her
Like I can to you
I can't tell her about music
Or the fact I'm being sued
She just makes me feel older
It's not the same
I'm starting to see
Who's the one to blame

Chorus


Extra Verse at SXSW Show - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX0EbusHl8A
Well, I tried to dam it
But it rolls off my tongue
You can't change a thing
You don't forgive anyone
So I took her to dinner
Yeah, but not out of spite
Cause it gets cold in this big house
And it gets worse in the night

Chorus
