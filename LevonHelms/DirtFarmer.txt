Oh the poor old dirt farmer he's lost all his corn

                              G          C
An now where's the money to pay off his loan

                      G                             C
He lost all his corn, can't pay off his loan

   C
He lost all his corn.



Well the poor old dirt farmer, he only grows stones
He's grows them all down, till they're big enough to roll
He rolls them on down to the tax man in town
He rolls them on down

[inst]

Now the poor old dirt farmer, he's goes out all alone,
His wife and his children, they pack up and gone
Pack up and gone, he'left all alone
They packed up and gone

Well the poor old dirt farmer how bad he must feel
He fell of his tractor, up under a wheel
And now his head is, shaped like a tread
But he aint quite dead

[inst]

Well the poor old dirt farmer he can't grow no corn
He can't grow no corn cause he aint got a lone
He aint got a loan, he can't grow no corn
He aint got no loan

[inst]
