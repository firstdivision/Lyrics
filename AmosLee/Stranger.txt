G7
I'm a stranger everywhere I go

G
They say the apple,
it don't fall 
far from the tree, 
"Hey Daddy look at me"

G
Well I went back 
and I knocked on that door
But the man said that "You're momma, 
she don't live here anymore"

G7
I'm a stranger everywhere I go

G
I ain't got no bags to pack
I ain't got nothing left to my name
I ain't got no goodbye letters
So I guess I'll get right on this here night train

I'm a stranger everywhere I go
I'm a stranger everywhere I go

Em                              C
And if anybody asks you if you seen me

Em
Tell them that you never, ever seen such a man
               C               D
And anyway, he ain't no friend in the end

[instrumental]

well that scarlet lady, 
she tread upon my crown
I think it is about high time that I head out 
of the here harbor town

And I'm a stranger everywhere I go

I'm a stranger everywhere I go
I'm a stranger everywhere I go
I'm a stranger everywhere I go
