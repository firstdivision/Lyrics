[Intro]
A7 D7 G
 
 
[Verse 1]
                                                  A7
They say I gotta be half crazy to be doing what I do
      D                                                       G
I'm a slap happy, gear jamming, coffee drinking, truck driving fool
 
I may have a little shimmy in this cracker box Jimmie
      A7
But I ain't never cracked up yet
           C                          G       E7
The more I try to make a buck in this beat up truck
         A7     D      G
The more semi crazy I get
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.             C                      G
Yeah, I'm semi-crazy, I gotta be half nuts
                                              A7      D7
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
          C
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
        G                    E7                      C     D7
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
               G    A7 D7 G
I'll be semi-crazy
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
I'm just a truck driving fool who never finished school
         A7
I got my learning at the old truck sto
            D
They said I won't amount to much
                                       
When a gear shift and a clutch was the only education I got
 
I'm just an old blue collar, semi-crazy road scholar
     A7
They tell me that I'm half insane
              C                       E7
And I've been driving so long, I got diesel in my blood
    A7             D7       G
And ninety weight oil on my brain
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.              C                       G
'Cause I'm semi-crazy, yeah, 'bout half nuts
                                              A7      D
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
          C
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
        G                    E7                      C     D7
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
               G    A7 D7 G
I'll be semi-crazy
 
 
[Verse 3]
                                                            A7
Everybody says we're dingy 'cause we're too semi-crazy to stop
           D7                                                        G
That's the handle that were stuck with, no matter if we like it or not
 
Through the desert and the mountains
                                A7
The sunshine, the rain and the snow
         C                                            E7
We'll be double clutching daddies 'til we're over the hill
          A7          D7      G
And we're never gonna take it slow
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.                C                       G
'Cause we're semi-crazy, we gotta be half nuts
                                              A7      D7
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
           C
We might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
          G                    E7                        C     D7
But we're never gonna give it up 'til we're pushing up daisies
                G   E7
We'll be semi-crazy
 
 
[Outro]
                         C     D7
'Til they put us in the ground
                        G  E7
They'll never shut us down
                     C    D
Till we're six feet under
                  G
We'll be rolling thunder
