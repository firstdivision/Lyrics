C                          G 
Ramblin boy, you've been around
                    Am
Dallas to the underground
                      F
High above and down below
                       C
Places I was scared to go
                              G
You sing it loud in case they heard
                    Am
Hanging on to every word
                 F
Gentle as a lullaby
                     C
Firecrackers in your eyes

                 G
And I would give anything
         Am
One more life to run
         F             C
One more song to sing 
                   G
You weren't asking much at all
     Am
Just catch you when you fall
        F
On your own
             C
The long way home

What's that sadness in your smile
Have you been crying all the while
Could you lean across my shoulder
Guess you die or just get older
So what are we supposed to do
Just walk around forever blue
And all this hurry-up and wait
Was it chance or was it fate

Repeat Chorus
