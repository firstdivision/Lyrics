Capo 3 if downtuned 1/2 step, Capo 2 if standard tuning


[Verse 1]
Am                                F
  she lived on a curve in the road  in an old tar paper shack
Am                                   F
  on the south side of the town on the wrong side of the tracks
C                  G
  sometimes on the way into town we say
  F
  mama can we stop and give her a ride
Am             G           F
  sometimes we did but her hands flew from her side
F             G       Am          F
 wild eyed...crazy...Mary

[Verse 2]
Am                     F
  down a long dirt road  past the Parson's place
Am                  F
  their old blue car  we used to race
C          G                     F
  a little country store, with a sign tacked to the side
         Am                     F
  said no L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G allowed
Am                                       F
  underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd

[Chorus]
Am                        G     F              G
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around, pass it a
Am                        G                F          G
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it a, pass it a, pass it around

[Bridge 1]
A
 one night the thunder cracked, mercy backed outside her windowsill
D
 dreamed I was flying high, above the trees, over the hills
A
 looked down into the house of Mary
E                    D
  bare bulb on, newspaper covered walls
A
  and Mary rising up, above it all

  A   D    A   D   A   A   G   F#m  F   E
  ah...... ah......

[Verse 3]
Am
   next morning on the way into town  
F
   we saw some skid marks and followed them around
Am                           F                         Am
  over the curb, through the fields, into the house of Mary


[Bridge 2]
              G                       F
that what you fear the most will meet you half way
              G                       F
that what you fear the most will meet you half way


[Chorus]
Am                        G     F              G
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around, pass it a
Am                        G                F          G
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it a, pass it a, pass it around


[Outro]
Am        F        Am        F        Am        F        Am        F
  Eddie 
Am        F        Am        F        Am        F        Am        F
