[Verse]
E
Unsealed
     B                    A
On a porch a letter sat
                      E
Then you said I wanna leave it again
E
Once I saw him
      B                        A
On a beach of weathered sand
                         E
And on the sand, I wanna leave him again

                  B
On a weekend, I'd wished it all away
          A
And they called and said, "I want what I said"
      E
And I called out again

E                    B
 And the reason on a leave of calm I know
A                                       E
 I said I don't want him to-be wear'n a-box or or a bag


[Chorus]
E                   B
Oh yeah, can you see them? 
           A
Out on the porch
                   E
Ah, but they don't wave
E
I see them
          B
Round the front way, yeah
      A
And I know and I know
              E
I don't wanna stay

make me cry

[Bridge]

E
I see
                            B
ooouw, I don't know there's something else
A                   E
I wanna drum it all away
E
An I said
A                                      E
I don't, I don't know whether there's ah box or or there's a bag

[Chorus]
E                    B
Oh yeah, can you see them?
           A
Out on the porch
                   E
Ah, but they don't wave
E
I see them
          B
Round the front way, yeah
A
And I know and I know
              E
I don't wanna stay alone  (during these play EEB, short pause, BAAE) repeat till fade
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay
