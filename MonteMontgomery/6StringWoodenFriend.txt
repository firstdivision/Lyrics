A C G

A
Here we are once again
   A/G
My six string wooden friend.
        D/F#        G            A
You're everything that I'm all about.
A
You've been battered and abused
       A/G
You've had to pay so many dues.
        D/F#   G               A
I'm half a man when I put you down.

         C/G             G
So let's play another song.
    D/F#             A
Let's drag it on too long.
    E             B          F#
And bring a tear again to my eye.
          C/G             G
You can't make me want to stop.
           D/F#             A
You're the only friend I've got.
           E             B               F#
And you'll never live to hear me say, goodbye.

I've never heard you shy away
From anything I want to play.
Your honesty always rings true.
Through you, you amplify my soul.
You do, by giving rock and roll
A melody that I can sing to.

[CHORUS]

I know that I've been rough on you.
I've beaten you so out of tune
That in return you make my fingers bleed.
So before I lay you down to rest
You prove that you are the very best
By bringing out the very best in me.

So let's play another song.
Let's drag it on too long.
And bring a tear again to my eye.
You can't make me want to stop.
You're the only friend I've got.
And you'll never live to hear me say, goodbye.

Here we are once again. My six string wooden friend.
You're everything that I'm all about.
