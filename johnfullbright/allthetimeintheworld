Capo 3

E
Are you gonna stop, and I said, "No sir, no sir,"
E                             A
I got a little bit of time to go
E
Where you gonna go, sir? up sir, up sir
E                              A  
Up to the middle of a mountain road

Where you gonna go When you get there, get there
I'm goin' go and see my gal
What's she gonna say When she see you, see you
She goin' say, boy, it's been a long while

Chorus:
A     G
Whoa, whoa
A     B7
Whoa, whoa
      E       G           A
I got all the time in the world

Crawled in a hole in a mountain, mountain
Trying to get away from the wind and rain
Climbed out, and Everybody's shoutin', shoutin'
Everybody talkin' 'bout their own damn pain

Moses was a man of action, action
He slapped the water and it turned to blood
Ain't no kind of leader for reaction, no sir
I know when to leave when the leavin's good

Chorus

Well, I was never any kind of scholar, no sir
Graduated school with a 2.0.
I told everybody I was leavin', "See you,"
Then I realized I ain't go no place to go

Central Oklahoma is my land, it's my country
Eastern Oklahoma is a beautiful sight
Northern Oklahoma might as well be Kansas
Never go to Southern Oklahoma at night

Chorus

Some peoples' lives are useless, useless
They're tryin' all the time to fill another man's shoes
Everybody out there is ruthless, ruthless
Try to follow me, and you're bound to lose

Maybe I will try to be a rich man, rich man
Build me a house that I can't be found
Maybe I will try to try to stay a poor man, poor man
Tryin' to make a livin' off the song and sound

Chorus
