E and A chords 

E
WELL I NEVER DID GET DOWN TO
ST MICHALES
WELL I NEVER DID GET DOWN TO 
ST MICHAELS

         A
I'D BEEN TRAVELIN 
        E
FOR TOO LONG
         B
I HAD TO GET HOME
              E
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG

A LONG TIME FLYIN
AND TRAVELLIN ON THE ROAD
A LONG TIME FLYIN
AND TRAVELLIN ON THE ROAD
IT WEARS ON THE MIND
SOMETIMES YOU WANNA GET HOME
WANT TO GET BACK THE RYTHMN
TOO LONG TO ROAM
