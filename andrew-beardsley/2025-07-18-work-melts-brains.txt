NOT ENOUGH TIME
TO DO THE WORK ASSIGNED
BUT THEY WANT EVEN MORE
AM I A CORPORATE WHORE?

THEY SAID YOU TAKE YOUR SEAT
AND YOU BETTER BETTER BELIEVE
WHAT WE SAY TO YOU
YOU TAKE AS THE WHOLE HONEST TRUTH

BUT WE LIE THROUGH OUR TEETH
AND STEAL YOUR DOLLARS UNDERNEATH
ADD THEM TO OUR GROWING PILE
AND MAKE MAKE YOU WALK ANOTHER MILE

[CHORUS]
WORK MELTS BRAINS
EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME
I WANT OFF OF THIS TRAIN
CAN YOU REALLY BLAME?
I GOT MESSAGES ON TEAMS
NEVER-ENDING MEETINGS
CAN YOU DO ALL THESE THINGS?
AND DON'T FORGET TO PRAISE ME
[/CHORUS]

I'M NEVER HAPPY
UNLESS I AM TAKING
I ALWAYS WANT MORE
WHY YOU LOOKING SO SORE?

I NEED MORE TIME FROM YOU
DON'T LOOK AT ME SO BLUE
THERE'S A RAISE IN THE WORKS
BUT FIRST I NEED DESSERT

I NEED ALL OF YOUR TIME
PRODUCTIVITY MINE
TAKE FROM YOU AND GIVE TO ME
THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE
