WORK MELTS BRAINS
CAPO 3 / DOWNTUNE 1/2 STEP

E
NOT ENOUGH TIME
          A
TO DO THE WORK ASSIGNED
         B
BUT THEY WANT EVEN MORE
       E
AM I A CORPORATE WHORE?

              E
THEY SAID YOU TAKE YOUR SEAT
        A
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE
        B
WHAT WE SAY TO YOU
                E
YOU TAKE AS THE WHOLE HONEST TRUTH

        E
BUT WE LIE THROUGH OUR TEETH
               A
AND STEAL YOUR DOLLARS UNDERNEATH
                B
ADD THEM TO OUR GROWING PILE
            E
AND MAKE YOU WALK ANOTHER MILE

[CHORUS]
A
WORK MELTS BRAINS
          E
EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME
        B
I WANT OFF OF THIS TRAIN
        E
CAN YOU REALLY BLAME?
       A
I GOT MESSAGES ON TEAMS
      E
NEVER-ENDING MEETINGS
        B
CAN YOU DO ALL THESE THINGS?
          E
AND DON'T FORGET TO PRAISE ME
[/CHORUS]

I'M NEVER HAPPY
UNLESS I AM TAKING
I ALWAYS WANT MORE
WHY YOU LOOKING SO SORE?

I NEED MORE TIME FROM YOU
DON'T LOOK AT ME SO BLUE
THERE'S A RAISE IN THE WORKS
BUT FIRST I NEED DESSERT

I NEED ALL OF YOUR TIME
PRODUCTIVITY MINE
TAKE FROM YOU AND GIVE TO ME
THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE
