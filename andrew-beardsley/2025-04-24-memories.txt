You left me too soon and I took it real bad
but I didn't show it, I just kept goin on
Doing the same thing, I had been all along
Tellin' myself that there is nothing wrong

Waking up and eating food, they tell me that I should
I'm not hungry, I'm just thirsty
I feel all alone - I know it's not just me
I need some company - also just let me be

Then I think of all all the good times in my mem-o-ries
Walks and swims, dinner and a whiskey glass
The time I fell down, looked like a dumb ass
Oh man, how did the time pass 

Fast is how we ran, always look in front of us
Getting on the bus, looking for the next thing
A change of clothes, is all we really need to bring
All it takes for us, is just suggesting

[chorus] - open chords in same verse chords
  I'm, thinkin' about you
  Can't get you off, my, mind
  No matter how I try. And,
  
  I'm, missin' you so bad
  Almost called you up
  Read the last text that we had
[/chorus]

You made me feel warm and comfort welcome
Record playing backwards or forward
It's funny how I feel bad, when I'm lookin' back
But there's so many things that I know that I had

When you're lucky, you're lucky and you know it's true
Love and light, and truth, and you
I'm so lucky to'v been through
All these thing that tie me to you

[chorus]

Fm   C   A#   A#m
And when I'm down
And thinking of you
I just remember your smile
Even though it's been a while

Even if you're not around
I can still feel you
I've made it back to ground
Some happiness I've found
[\bridge]
