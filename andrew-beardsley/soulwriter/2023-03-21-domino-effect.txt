DOMINO EFFECT
----------------------------------

BIT BY BIT, THE TIME DOES PASS
IT HAPPENS TO US ALL
WATCHING ALL THE TILES
TILL THE LAST ONE FINALLY FALLS

FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN IT SEEMS
IT HAPPENS TO A CADENCE
IS THERE ORDER IN THIS CHAOS 
OR IS IT ALL JUST CHANCE

[HOLD FOUR BEATS]

CARS ON WET ROADS THAT ARE BLACK
MAKES ME THINK IT'S STILL RAINING
IS THAT THE TRUTH OR IS IT PAINT
OR JUST MY BRAIN EXPLAINING

SNOW STILL FALLS AND SUN STILL SHINES
AND BIRDS ARE STILL AWAKING
I LOOK UPON THE SUN OF FIRE
I FEEL THE GROUND IS SHAKING

[GRUNGE BRIDGE]
IT'S THE....DOMINO EFFECT
IT'S THE....DOMINO EFFECT

MY FRIEND

IT'S THE DOMINO EFFECT


I TAKE A BREATH AND STEP AWAY
BUT I ALWAYS STEP BACK IN
THE WANDERED PATH SEEMS ATTRACTIVE
UNTIL IT'S ONE YOU'VE BEEN ON

MILES AND MILES AND YEARS AND YEARS
THEY FALL DOWN BEHIND ME
IF I CARED TO LOOK I'D SEE THEM ALL
BUT I WOULD RATHER NOT SEE

[HOLD FOUR BEATS]

UNCERTAINY, AND NOTHING FREE
AND WONDERING IF YOU'RE STILL
WELCOME IN THE PLACE YOU LEFT
WITHOUT A DOLLAR BILL

FOUR HUNDRED MILES SEEMS A LONG WAY
UNTIL YOU'VE DONE TEN THOUSAND
NOT TOO MUCH LONGER ON THAT PATH
UNTIL YOU FEEL YOU'RE BROWSING
