BIT BY BIT, THE TIME DOES PASS
IT HAPPENS TO US ALL
WATCHING ALL THE TILES
TILL THE LAST ONE FINALLY FALLS

FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN IT SEEMS
IT HAPPENS TO A CADENCE
IS THERE ORDER IN THIS CHAOS 
OR IS IT ALL JUST CHANCE

CARS ON WET ROADS THAT ARE BLACK
MAKES ME THINK IT'S STILL RAINING
IS THAT THE TRUTH OR IS IT PAINT
OR JUST MY BRAIN EXPLAINING

SNOW STILL FALLS AND SUN STILL SHINES
AND BIRDS ARE STILL AWAKING
I LOOK UPON THE SUN OF FIRE
I FEEL THE GROUND IS SHAKING
