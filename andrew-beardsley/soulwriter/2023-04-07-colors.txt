THE COLORS OF THE WHEEL
THEY ARE ALWAYS CHANGING
SOMETIMES COMPLIMENTARY
BUT ALWAYS RE-ARRANGING





DON'T KEEP ME IN THE DARK
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
ARE YOU SEEING RED?
IT'S A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

I'VE GIVEN YOU THE GREEN LIGHT
NOW PLEASE SPEAK TO ME
DO YOU HAVE THE BLUES?
ARE YOU GREEN WITH ENVY?

DON'T COLOR ME SURPRISED
HAVE I CAUGHT YOU RED-HANDED?
IT'S NOT A GRAY AREA
THE SILVER SPOON YOU WERE HANDED

IS IT BLACK AND BLUE.
OR MORE BLACK AND WHITE?
THROUGH ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.
IS HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME.
