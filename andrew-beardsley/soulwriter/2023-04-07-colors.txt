THE COLORS OF THE WHEEL
THEY ARE ALWAYS CHANGING
SOMETIMES COMPLIMENTARY
BUT ALWAYS RE-ARRANGING





DON'T KEEP ME IN THE DARK
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
ARE YOU SEEING RED?
IT'S A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

I'VE GIVEN YOU THE GREEN LIGHT
NOW PLEASE SPEAK TO ME
DO YOU HAVE THE BLUES?
ARE YOU GREEN WITH ENVY?

DON'T COLOR ME SURPRISED
HAVE I CAUGHT YOU RED-HANDED?
IT'S NOT A GRAY AREA
THE SILVER SPOON YOU WERE HANDED

IS IT BLACK AND BLUE.
OR MORE BLACK AND WHITE?
THROUGH ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.
IS HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME.

[CHORUS]

A BLOOD ORANGE SUNSET
BLACK SHEEP ON THE HORIZON
SOON WE'LL BE IN THE DARK
OR MAYBE OVER FLYING

ON A RED-EYE FLIGHT
TO SOMEWHERE WE DON'T KNOW
ONCE IN A BLUE MOON
ANOTHER PLACE TO GO

YOU SHOWED ME YOUR TRUE COLORS
YOUR CHEEKS WERE BRIGHT RED
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DARK
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID

I DON'T WANT TO BE THE BLACK SHEEP
ANY MORE I WANT TO TRY
TO BE A SILVER STARLIGHT
THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE
