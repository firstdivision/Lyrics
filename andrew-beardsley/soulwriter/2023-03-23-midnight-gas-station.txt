E               B7
MIDNIGHT AT THE GAS STATION
    E                B7
YOU SEE ALL KINDS OF THINGS
E             B7
PEOPLE BUYING BEER
    E              B7
AND OTHERS SMOKING WEED

SCRATCHING TICKETS OR THEIR HEAD
THE VERY NEARLY DEAD
RACOONS IN THE GARBAGE
A WOMAN BUYING BREAD

THAT'S A NICE CAR MAN
WATCH OUT FOR THR COPS
I SAW THEM CRUISING BY
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO STOP

THANKS MAN BY THE WAY
DID YOU SEE THE SHELVES IN THERE?
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE STOCKING MUCH
THEY'RE ALMOST OUT OF BEER

[CHORUS]
      A     
THESE ARE MY KIND OF PEOPLE
      E
THEY STAY UP VERY LATE
     A
THEY DON'T LIKE EARLY MORNINGS
    B7
AND VERY RARELY HATE
(EXCEPT THE CCRAZY ONES)
