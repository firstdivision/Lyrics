Soulwriters Prompt: Echos of a memory
---------------------------------------------

E
ECHOS OF THE PAST
      A
ALWAYS COME FLYING BY
        E
LIKE A LEAF ON A RIVER
B7
SLOWLY DRIFTING BY

          E
YOU'LL BE SITTING THERE COOKING DINNER
         A
STIRRING SOUP REAL SLOW
E
SUDDENLY YOU REMEMBER
      B7
THAT TIME LONG AGO

[CHORUS 1]
        A            E
WAS IT, SAILING ON A BOAT?
A           E
BEING TOWED BEHIND
     E     
ON A MAKESHIFT BOOGIE BOARD
    B7
THE PLYWOOD KIND

E
YOU NEVER CAN TELL
           A
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ARRIVE
                   E
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED MEMORIES
     B7
THEY LIKE TO STAY ALIVE
[CHORUS 1]

GOING SKIING UP NORTH
IT'S BEEN SNOWING WELL
LETS GET IN THE JEEP
AND GIVE THAT MOUNTAIN HELL

WE CAN SLEEP WHEN WE GET THERE
AND BE THE FIRST ON THE LIFT
THIS LATE WINTER STORM
SURELY WAS A GIFT

[CHORUS 2]
A LIFT TO THE TOP
FIRST TRACKS IN THE SNOW
SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS
A LONG TIME AGO

YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ARRIVE
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED MEMORIES
THEY LIKE TO STAY ALIVE
[/CHORUS]

[INST]

GETTING ON A PLANE
TO A BRAND NEW PLACE
ALWAYS BRANG A BIG SMILE
TO MY CHILDHOOD FACE

WAKE UP AT HOME
AND IN A FEW MORE HOURS
WE'LL BE ADVENTURING
CLIMBING NEW TOWERS

[CHORUS 3]
LONDON AND FRANCE
FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC
IT DON'T MATTER MUCH
WHAT THE PLAN IS

YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ARRIVE
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED MEMORIES
THEY LIKE TO STAY ALIVE
[/CHORUS]
