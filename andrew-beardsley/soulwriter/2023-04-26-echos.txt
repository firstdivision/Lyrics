ECHOS OF THE PAST
ALWAYS COME FLYING BY
LIKE A LEAF ON A RIVER
SLOWLY DRIFTING BY

YOU'LL BE SITTING THERE COOKING DINNER
STIRRING SOUP REAL SLOW
SUDDENLY YOU REMEMBER
THAT TIME LONG AGO

[CHORUS 1]
        C            G
WAS IT, SAILING ON A BOAT?
C           G
BEING TOWED BEHIND
     C     
ON A MAKESHIFT BOOGIE BOARD
    D
THE PLYWOOD KIND

YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ARRIVE
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED MEMORIES
THEY LIKE TO STAY ALIVE
[CHORUS 1]

GOING SKIING UP NORTH
IT'S BEEN SNOWING WELL
LETS GET IN THE JEEP
AND GIVE THAT MOUNTAIN HELL

WE CAN SLEEP WHEN WE GET THERE
AND BE THE FIRST ON THE LIFT
THIS LATE WINTER STORM
SURELY WAS A GIFT

[CHORUS 2]
A LIFT TO THE TOP
FIRST TRACKS IN THE SNOW
SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS
A LONG TIME AGO

YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ARRIVE
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED MEMORIES
THEY LIKE TO STAY ALIVE
[/CHORUS]

[INST]

GETTING ON A PLANE
TO A BRAND NEW PLACE
ALWAYS BRANG A BIG SMILE
TO MY CHILDHOOD FACE

WAKE UP AT HOME
AND IN A FEW MORE HOURS
WE'LL BE ADVENTURING
CLIMBING NEW TOWERS

[CHORUS 3]
LONDON AND FRANCE
FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC
IT DON'T MATTER MUCH
WHAT THE PLAN IS

YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ARRIVE
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED MEMORIES
THEY LIKE TO STAY ALIVE
[/CHORUS]
