DOMINO EFFECT
----------------------------------
  A
I BOUGHT A BOAT IT WAS MY FIRST
                       D
SOMETHING I HAD ALWAYS WANTED
        E
SHE WAS TEN LONG FEET AND NEEDED PAINT
            E
BUT SHE WAS MINE
                      A
AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS GREAT

A SPRING OF WORK AND POLISHING
I RAISED THE SAILS AND HEADED OUT
IT WAS ONLY A SMALL SALT POND
BUT WE EXPLORED THE SHORES AND BEYOND

IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE I OUTGREW
MY FIRST SAILING LOVE AND TRADED UP
TWENTY FEET OF FIBERGLASS
WITH A COUPLE PLACES TO KEEP MY CUP

THAT'S HOW IT STARTS AND HOW IT GOES
THE SAILOR'S HEART IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT
A PLACE TO GO AND PLACE TO BE
A COURSE TO PLOT, SILENCE OF THE SEA

[CHORUS]
          D
IT'S THE DOMINO EFFECT
        E
LOOKING ON THE HORIZON
A
WATCHING THE SUN
    F#
AS IT IS SLOWLY RISING
          D                
TRIM THE SAILS AND SET THE COURSE
   E
MY FRIEND
         A
IT'S THE DOMINO EFFECT

[SOLO 1]

BEFORE TOO LONG I RAN OUT OF CASH
AND HAD TO LOOK FOR BIGGER BOATS TO TAKE ME ON
I'D WORK AS CREW AND DO DELIVERIES 
WHATEVER IT TOOK TO KEEP
ME IN THE SEA BREEZE

OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND AND TRIMMING SAILS
THAT'S WHERE I WAS ALWAYS MOST HAPPY
NO COMPUTER SCREENS OR LONG MEETINGS
JUST A CREW, THE BOAT AND 
ALL THE FISH IN THE SEA

FOUR HUNDRED MILES SEEMS A LONG WAY
UNTIL YOU'VE DONE TEN THOUSAND UNDER SAIL
EIGHT MILES EVERY HOUR, IF WE'RE LUCKY
TOMORROW WE'LL HAVE BEERS ON THE RAIL

[CHORUS 2X?]
[OUTRO SOLO]
