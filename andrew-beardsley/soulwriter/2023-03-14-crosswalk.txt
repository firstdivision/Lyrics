crosswalk

Standing in a crosswalk
somewhere downtown
it's been a while
since I've been around
this place is different
I feel out of place
where are the good times?
have they been erased?

A man with a bottle
a woman asleep
I don't recognize
any place I used to be
Everything is empty
This place has changed
The lights look the same
but this place has changed

[chorus]
Used to be
there was things going on
used to be
a million different songs
now the streets are empty
except for the people sleeping
what has happened
where did the good times go?

[solo]

The drinks are still cold
And the tenders pour well
but the feeling's not the same
I think I can tell
this place ain't happy
it's just a shell
The tide has gone out
no water in the well

Skirts are still short
and the lights are still on
It's a pretty house
but there's nobody home
not like in my memory
not what it used to be
this place is different
maybe it's not for me

[chorus]

[outro / solo]
