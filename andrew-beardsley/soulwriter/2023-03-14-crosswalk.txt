Crosswalk
Blues feel

C#m  (walk up G# B)
Standing in a crosswalk
    C#m
somewhere downtown
     C#
it's been a while
      C#
since I've been around
              F#m
this place is different
              C#
I feel out of place
               G
where are the good times?
F#m
    have they been erased?

A man with a bottle
a woman asleep
I don't recognize
any place I used to be
Everything is empty
This place has changed
The lights look the same
but this place has changed

[chorus]
F#m
Used to be
there was things going on
         C#m
used to be
a million different songs
        F#m
now the streets are empty
       F#m
except for the people sleeping
         G
what has happened
                         C#m
where did the good times go?

[solo]

The drinks are still cold
And the tenders pour well
but the feeling's not the same
I think I can tell
this place ain't happy
it's just a shell
The tide has gone out
no water in the well

Skirts are still short
and the lights are still on
It's a pretty house
but there's nobody home
not like in my memory
not what it used to be
this place is different
maybe it's not for me

[chorus]

[outro / solo]
