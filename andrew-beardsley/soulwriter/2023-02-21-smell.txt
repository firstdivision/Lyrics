A faint memory
of slowly awake
was that the sound of beans
or was that my mistake?

Suspicion confirmed
don't have to open my eyes
it's coffee being made
I think I will rise


Fresh fallen snow
clean and pristine
makes everytyhing else
a colorful scene

an empty canvas
a pallet cleanse
comin' home to fresh cookin'
hits all the senses

[chorus]
     C
They say a smell
    G
can hit your brain
     D
and find memories
   D
of love and pain
  C
can be tied to
       G
things buried deep
                   D
somewhere, hidden away
[/chorus]



I for one do know
it is true
I've had it happen
through and through
but mostly
they remind me of you
