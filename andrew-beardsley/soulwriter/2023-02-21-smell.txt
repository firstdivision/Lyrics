   D
A faint memory
    C
of slowly awake
              G
was that the sound of beans
   D
or was that my mistake?
   D
Suspicion confirmed
              C
don't have to open my eyes
      G
it's coffee being made
  D
I think I will rise


Fresh fallen snow
clean and pristine
makes everything else
a colorful scene

an empty canvas
a pallet cleanse
comin' home to fresh cookin'
hits all the senses

[chorus]
     C
They say a smell
    G
can hit your brain
     D
and find memories
   D
of love and pain
  C
can be tied to
       G
things buried deep
                   D
somewhere, hidden away
[/chorus]


I'm on a lobster boat
But it ain't mine
Heading out to set some traps
two to a line

They said they've got the good bait
Didn't know what they meant
Until I got a good whiff

[Bridge]
        Bm
Is it a trick of chemistry
          G
Or different entirely
      D
Is it nothing?
         A
Or is it everything?
     Bm
A desire to remember
      F#
A de-fense against the past?
        G
A re-enforcement
A
Make them live and last
