V2]
YOU GOTTA HOIST YOUR SAIL
TRIM IT GOOD AND TRUE
GET UP ON ON THE RAIL
NO NEED TO BAIL
THERE'S NO INCOMING GALE
COMING AFTER YOU
TAKE THE WAVES AS THEY GO
IT'S THE EBB AND FLOW

[INST]

YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING WEIGHT
MORE THAN YOU SHOULD
I SAW YOU TODAY
YOU SEEM TO BE FRAYED
YOU NEED TO GIVE WAY
IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD
YOU NEED TO LET IT GO
LET IT EBB AND FLOW

I KNOW YOU'RE STRONG
I'VE SEEN IT A LOT
I LISTENED TO YOUR SONG
AND YOU'RE NOT WRONG
YOU WANT TO BELONG
JUST GIVE IT A SHOT
GIVE 'EM A SHOW
LET IT EBB AND FLOW
