I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW COULD I TELL
I GUESS I DIDN'T KNOW 
YOU SO WELL
HOW COULD I KNOW?
WHICH WAY YOU WOULD GO
IF YOU DIDN'T SHOW
ABOUT THE EBB AND FLOW

[INST1]

YOU GOTTA HOIST YOUR SAIL
TRIM IT GOOD AND TRUE
GET UP ON ON THE RAIL
NO NEED TO BAIL
THERE'S NO INCOMING GALE
COMING AFTER YOU
TAKE THE WAVES AS THEY GO
IT'S THE EBB AND FLOW

[INST2]
