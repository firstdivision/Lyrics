I'M ROOTED IN SUSPICION
I HAVE TROUBLE WITH TRUST
I DON'T LIKE MEETING PEOPLE
I AM ONLY JUST

A SIMPLE CREATURE HERE NOW
DON'T STARE TOO LONG AT ME
I MIGHT BE ANGRY AT YOU
OR I MAY BE HAPPY

[SHORT CHORUS / BRIDGE]
OOOH AND AHHS

TO SEE YOU COMING NEAR ME
I MIGHT WALK AWAY
I MIGHT LET YOU SAY HELLO
I MIGHT LET YOU STAY

IN MY PRESENCE WITH ME
IT'S NOT YOUR CHOICE BUT MINE
I'M ALWAYS WITH CONFUSIUON
I AM JUST A FELINE

[CHORUS]
OOOOH, WHOAH OHHHH OH
I AM A CAT
I MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS
MY CLAWS ARE VERY SHARP
THAN CAN CAUSE INCISIONS

YOU BELONG TO ME
NOT THE OTHER WAY 'ROUND
AND BY THE WAY WHERE IS
THE FOOD ON THE GROUND
WHOOOS OOH OH
WOE IS ME
WHOOOOAH OOOH
WHOOOAH OOOH OH
WOE IS ME
[/CHORUS]

MY LITTER BOX LOOKS FULL
YOU SHOULD PROB'LY CLEAN IT
AM I NOTHING TO YOU?
I'M NOT A NORMAL PET

I'M A KING AND QUEEN
THE RULER OF THIS NATION
DO YOU NOT SEE YOU PLACE?
YOU HAVE A LOWLY STATION

[SHORT CHORUS]

I DON'T LIKE THIS NEW FOOD
ON YOU I'VE BEEN SPYING
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
ARE YOU EVEN TRYING?

THE CAN LOOKS DIFFERENT
IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE KIND
THIS IS CLEARLY GARBAGE
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE TRY

[CHORUS]

WOE IS ME
WOE IS ME
WOE IS ME
CAN'T YOU SEE?

WOE IS ME
WOE IS ME
WOE IS ME!
