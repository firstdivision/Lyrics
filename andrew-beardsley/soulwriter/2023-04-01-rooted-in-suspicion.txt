I'M ROOTED IN SUSPICION
I HAVE TROUBLE WITH TRUST
I DON'T LIKE MEETING PEOPLE
I AM ONLY JUST

A SIMPLE CREATURE HERE NOW
DON'T STARE TOO LONG AT ME
I MIGHT BE ANGRY AT YOU
OR I MAY BE HAPPY

TO SEE YOU COMING NEAR ME
I MIGHT WALK AWAY
I MIGHT LET YOU SAY HELLO
I MIGHT LET YOU STAY

IN MY PRESENCE WITH ME
IT'S NOT YOUR CHOICE BUT MINE
I'M ALWAYS WITH CONFUSIUON
I AM JUST A FELINE
