Capo 2

           E
Something new
        A
See it through
             E
Maybe new to me
             B7
Maybe old to you

           E
Something pure
                 A
That's what I've seen
              E
But I've seen you
B7                  E
      Have you seen me

[CHORUS]
       A
I see blue skies
            E
and endless fields
             E
I feel their touch
               B7
my breath they steal

             E
I hear your song
                A
In the dark of night
         E
With no distractions
B7                    E
        Your voice is bright
        

[VERSE]
When I think of you
My mind is clear
And when you're near
I need your ear

I love your patience
With my rambling words
You make my jumbled mind
Feel less absurd

[CHORUS]
I was lost, and wandering
Across this whole damn place
Till that one day
I saw your face

I knew right then, I could sit right down
as long you're with me
So what do you say?
Let's see what can be

[INST]

[VERSE]
I've said my piece
Wrote the words down
I think you know
I need you around

So if you'll have me
I'm yours for everything
Love you forever
Love you every day
Love you forever
Love you every day
