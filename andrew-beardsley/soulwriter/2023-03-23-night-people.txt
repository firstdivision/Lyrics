E               B7
MIDNIGHT AT THE GAS STATION
    E                B7
YOU SEE ALL KINDS OF THINGS
E             B7
PEOPLE BUYING BEER
    E              B7
AND OTHERS SMOKING WEED

SCRATCHING TICKETS OR THEIR HEAD
THE VERY NEARLY DEAD
RACOONS IN THE GARBAGE
A WOMAN BUYING BREAD

THAT'S A NICE CAR MAN
BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE COPS
I SAW THEM CRUISING BY
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO STOP

THANKS MAN BY THE WAY
DID YOU SEE THE SHELVES IN THERE?
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE STOCKING MUCH
THEY'RE ALMOST OUT OF BEER

[CHORUS]
      A     
THESE ARE MY KIND OF PEOPLE
      E
THEY STAY UP VERY LATE
     A
THEY DON'T LIKE EARLY MORNINGS
    B7
AND VERY RARELY HATE
(except the crazy ones)
(well maybe some of em)


I HAD A CONVERSATION
WITH AN UBER DRIVER, HE WAS
FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY
HIS FAMILY SOLE PROVIDER

HE USED TO FLY HELICOPTERS
IN HIS COUNTRY'S ARMY
BUT HE MOVED HERE TO THE STATES
BECAUSE HE MAKES MORE MONEY

THE HOMELESS MAN WHO BUMMED A SMOKE
BACK WHEN I STILL DID
TOLD ME A STORY
ABOUT HIS WIFE AND KID

THEY LEFT HIM ALONE
MANY YEARS AGO
HE SAID IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT
BUT I AM NOT SO SURE

[CHORUS]
[SOLO]

THE CLERK AT THE COUNTER
SWITCHES TO SPANISH
SHE ASKS A MAN FOR HIS ID
FOR HIS BEERS AND SANDWICH

QUANTOS AÃ‘OS
I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTOOD HER
HE SEEMED TO APPRECIATE
HE HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR

A WOMAN WITH A CHILD
WHY IS HE AWAKE AND WITH HER?
BUT WHO AM I TO JUDGE?
SHE'S BUYING PEANUT BUTTER

SIT BACK AND OBSERVE
THE VARIED POPULATION
A NOVEL FULL OF CHARACTERS
AT MIDNIGHT GAS STATION

[SOLO / OUTRO]
