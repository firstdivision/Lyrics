[VERSE1]
WELL THERE IT IS
THAT'S THE SMELL
ONE THAT I REMEMBER
SO VERY WELL

IT TAKES ME BACK
IT GIVES ME CHILLS
MAKES ME THINK
OF SNOW-CAPPED HILLS

THE FIRST ONE IS SLOW
ALWAYS TAKES A WHILE
LIKE IT'S WAKING UP 
WITH A LAZY SMILE

BUT SOON ENOUGH
THERE'S A BED OF COALS
FROM A DEEP SLEEP SHE WAKES

[CHORUS]
     C         D
IF I COULD I WOULD
	   G    D/F#    EM
DO THE BEST THAT I COULD
      C                 D
TO GIVE YOU ALL THOSE SAME
G
MEMORIES

[VERSE2]
IT'S BEEN STORMING 
TWO DAYS IN A ROW
WE'VE BEEN WALKING, EXPLORING
ALL THROUGH THE SNOW

THERE'S NOTHING BETTER
THAN COMING BACK HOME
TO THE WARM COMFORT OF
SWEET RED GLOW OF COALS

POUR DRINKS OF WHISKEY
IN THE BEST GLASS WE HAVE
SIT DOWN ON THE COUCH
AND LET THE HEAT RELAX

PUT UP OUR FEET
TILL OUR SOCKS ARE DRY
MAYBE ANOTHER GLASS
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT

[CHORUS]

[INST OVER VERSE]
