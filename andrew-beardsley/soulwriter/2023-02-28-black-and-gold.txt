I DONT LIKE A COLD, COLD LADY
GIMME ONE FUZZY AND WARM
SOMEONE WHO CAN HOLD
ME THE RIGHT WAY

SHE LIKES THE MUSIC THAT I DO
AND I LIKE HER MUSIC TOO
THATS THE KIND OF WOMAN
THAT MAKES MY DAY

SHE CAN SIT AND DRINK WITH ME
CONSISTANTLY
BEER, COLD WINE
AND WHISKEY

OR HEAD OUT ON THE MOUNTAIN
UP TO THE TOP AND SHOUTIN'
SOMETIMES TWO HEART OF BLACK
CAN TURN TO GOLD

[INST]


I FOUND ONE PRICKLY AND MEAN
ANGRIEST ONE I EVER SEEN
I'D RATHER SLEEP ON A CACTUS
THAN BE AROUND YOU

IT WAS FUN FOR A LITTLE BIT
TIL THAT FUSE SOMEHOW WAS LIT
FIRECRACKER IN MY HAND
I GOTTA THROW

THE BREAKFAST DIDN'T WORK
SHE CALLED ME A STUPID JERK
SHE SAID SOME THINGS
SHE COULDN'T TAKEW BACK

SO I HEAD OUT OF THE DOOR
VOICE HARSH AND FEELING SORE
SOMETIMES TWO HEART OF GOLD
CAN TURN TO BLACK
