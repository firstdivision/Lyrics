On the day when I set sail
Straight into a mighty gale
buried the rail
right into the sea

Straight down south and off the coast
the thing that I like most
Watching land hide behind me

Go three days without a sight
Just the birds and stars at night
The Sun, and me

---- chorus?  interlude?

Came upon a distant shore
Just couldn't sail no more
Drifting in the breeze

Left the water, dropped the sheets
For whiskey bars and crowded streets
Drinking from Pecan Trees

...this is where I ran out of words / motivation (work in progress).
