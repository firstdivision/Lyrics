TITLE: DROWNED RAT

CHORDS:
E   Bm   A

[VERSE]
  E                            Bm
I EMERGED LIKE A DROWN RAT IN MAINE
 A                                  E
NEVER SAW IT COMIN', THAT ELLSWORTH RAIN
BLURRY ROADS, HEAVENLY FALLS
POUNDING SOUNDS I GO INSANE

FROM HEAD TO TOE I'M WET WITH RAGE
FUNNY HOW THE ENGINE FADES
THIS SCREECHING SHOWER CREATED
OH, SUCH AN EVERGLADE

[CHORUS]
A
I'M OUT IN THE RAIN
    E
AND IT'S POURING DOWN
    A
I'M OUT IN THE RAIN
       B
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF TOWN
 ....hold....       E                             
WON'T YOU GET ME TO RIGHT PLACE I GOTTA BE
          B
FIND ME A PLACE THAT'S WARM AND DRY
  A
A GLASS OF WHISKY AND A FIRE
B       A          E
SOUNDS JUST ABOUT RIGHT
 
[INTERLUDE]

[VERSE]
IT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY, WHO NEEDS TO DRIVE
SHOES ARE WET, BUT MY SOUL IS ALIVE
I'M A CHILD CHASING PUDDLES, SPLASHIN' AND JOKIN'
IT MIGHT RAINING BUT I FEEL, I HAVE ARRIVED

WALKING INTO THE DOOR, I SEE A LOT OF SMILES
I'M GLAD NOW THAT I WALKED THOSE MILES
AT THE TIME, IT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT MUCH
BUT IT IN THE END, IT'S ALL WORTHWILE

[CHORUS]

[VERSE]
COLD AIR, AND CHANGING LEAVES
THEY FALL IN THE FALL, WHAT THE COLD AIR BRINGS
THE END OF SUMMER, BEGINNING OF SNOW
SOME MIGHT SAY, THEY LIKE THESE THINGS

BUT LIKE A BANSEE SHE CRIES, ON A COLD WINTER TRAIL
ROLLING ECHOS I HEAR...SHE BEGINS TO WAIL
MY FEET ARE COLD, MY HANDS ARE NUMB
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO BAIL

[CHORUS]
[SOLO]
[CHORUS]
[OUTRO]
