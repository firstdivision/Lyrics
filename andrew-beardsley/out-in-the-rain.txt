CHORDS:
E   Bm   A

[VERSE]
  E                            Bm
I EMERGED LIKE A DROWN RAT IN MAINE
 A                                  E
NEVER SAW IT COMIN', THAT ELLSWORTH RAIN
BLURRY ROADS, HEAVENLY FALLS
POUNDING SOUNDS I GO INSANE

FROM HEAD TO TOE I'M WET WITH RAGE
FUNNY HOW THE ENGINE FADES
THIS SCREECHING SHOWER CREATED
OH, SUCH AN EVERGLADE

[CHORUS]
A
I'M OUT IN THE RAIN
    E
AND IT'S POURING DOWN
    A
I'M OUT IN THE RAIN
       B
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF TOWN
 ....hold....       E                             
WON'T YOU GET ME TO RIGHT PLACE I GOTTA BE
          B
FIND ME A PLACE THAT'S WARM AND DRY
  A
A GLASS OF WHISKY AND A FIRE
B       A          E
SOUNDS JUST ABOUT RIGHT
 

[SOLO 1]

IT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY, WHO NEEDS TO DRIVE
SHOES ARE WET, BUT MY SOUL IS ALIVE
I'M A CHILD CHASING PUDDLES, SPLASHIN' AND JOKIN'
IT MIGHT RAINING BUT I FEEL, I HAVE ARRIVED

WALKING INTO THE DOOR, I SEE A LOT OF SMILES
I'M GLAD NOW THAT I WALKED THOSE MILES
AT THE TIME, IT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT MUCH
BUT IT IN THE END, IT'S ALL WORTHWILE

[CHORUS]
[FULL SOLO]
