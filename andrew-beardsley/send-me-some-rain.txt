Capo 2
C   F   G


              F
IT'S BEEN THE SAME
             C
FOR TOO MANY DAYS
      g
MIGHT SEEM
          C
LIKE SOME CLICHE

BUT ITS BEEN DRY
AND IT'S BEEN HOT
FOR WAY TOO
DAMN LONG

AND WON'T YOU SEND
ME SOME REPRIEVE
I AM BEGGING
WON'T YOU PLEASE

LET ME WAKE UP TOMORROW
AND FIND THE ANSWER
TO MY PRYER
I SEND TO YOU

FILL UP THE LAKES
BEHIND THE DAMS
UNTIL THEY HAVE TO 
OPEN THEM UP

SEND THE CLOUDS
MAKE THEM BIG AND TALL
WON'T YOU SEND ME
SEND ME SOME RAIN
