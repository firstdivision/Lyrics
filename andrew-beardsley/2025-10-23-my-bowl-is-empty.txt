MISS MY FAVOITE TOY
I NEVER WILL FIND NO MORE
I MISS MY FAVORITE TOY
I NEVER WILL FIND NO MORE
I'LL MISS THAT SQUEAKY MOUSE
DO THEY HAVE MORE AT THE STORE?

THE SUN KEEPS ON MOVING
ALL ACROSS THE FLOOR
THE SUN KEEPS ON MOVING
ALL ACROSS THE FLOOR
I TRY TO STAY WARM
BUT IT IS SUCH A CHORE
	
[CHORUS]
MY BOWL IS EMPTY
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED
WELL MY BOWL IS EMPTY
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE
AND I FEEL IT WILL AGAIN

THE DOG IS LOOKIN' AT ME
LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG
WEEEEL THE DOG IT LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG
IF HE DIDN'T WANT GET SLAPPED IN THE FACE
THEN SHOULDA' LEFT ME ALONE

HE'S A BIG CRYBABY
ALWAYS WANT'S TO GO FOR A WALK
HE'S A BIG CRYBABY
WANT'S TO WALK AND WALK
DON'T THINK HE CAN EVEN PURR
THE HUMANS THINK HE CAN TALK

[CHORUS X 2]
