What is a mother?
Does she sing to you?
What is a mother?
Does she read to you?
What is a mother?
Does she love you?
Don't know about you,
But my mother do.

What is a mother?
Does she write with you?
What is a mother?
Does she paint for you?
What is a mother?
Does she love you?
Don't know about you
But my mother do.


[Chorus]
Mother's are something
Everybody has one.
I've got mine,
and she's the one.
She watched over me
as I grew.
I'm sure she knows
I love her too.
[/chorus]

[inst]

What is a mother?
Does she cook for you?
Does she buy you Guns & Roses
When you're feeling blue?
What is a mother?
She hides those jelly beans.
She wraps the presents
under the tree.

French Toast in the morning,
fried chicken at night.
Pointing at the Star Trek
when it comes in sight.
Talking about Gunslinger,
and Frodo too.
Don't know about you.
But my mother do.

[chorus]
