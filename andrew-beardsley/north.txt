         C     F           C
Have you ever wanted to go sailing?
         Am   Dm             G
Have you ever just slipped away?
C          F          C
I have and I miss the freedom
   Am       Dm           G
Of knowing where I will go

             C     F        C
It's not the place it's the journey
         Am     Dm       G
It's the single point of mind
         C        F        C
It's the trust in ship and crew
    Am      Dm              G
And knowing exactly what to do

[chorus]
Am     F           C
And if you were to ask me
Am      F        C
And if you'll belive me
Am     F      C
I will try to show you
Am                     D
Here's what you should know

Am             F              C
Look down, the needle's still North
Am         F              C
No need to try and change course
         Am     F             C
Keep the rudder amidships and true
      Am                   Dm     G
Soon enough you'll be here too   ohhhh

C                F        C
When sails fill, you can feel it
   Am     Dm           G
It starts down in your toes
    C    F            C
The rest shortly does follow
    Am    Dm              G
Raw power pushing you foward

C            F            C
One with the wind and the water
Am           Dm            G
One with the wheel in your hand
C            F             C
One with the boat and your dreams
 Am      Dm           G
Together crossing the seas
