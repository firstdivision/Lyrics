=========================================

[Verse 1]
G                         C
Sunrise breaks and I’m still wide awake,  
G                           D
Chasing the light for the choices I made.  
G                           C
Lost my love in a foolish game,  
G                       D
Now the rhythm just repeats her name.  

G                       C
I lit the fire just to watch it burn,  
G                           D
Never believed she would not return.  
G                       C
Now I’m singing to the empty sky,  
G                         D
Praying for one more chance to try.  

[Chorus]
Em                C
Carry me over, wash me clean,  
G                   D
Take me back to where we’ve been.  
Em                 C
Every wrong, I’d make it right,  
G                      D
If love could turn the tide tonight.  

[Verse 2]
G                       C
Streets still hum with the songs we knew,  
G                          D
Every corner whispers I’m missing you.  
G                          C
I’d trade the gold, I’d trade the crown,  
         G         D            G
Just to turn these wheels back ‘round.  

G                          C
Time won’t wait and the clock won’t bend,  
G                          D
But I’d give it all just to start again.  
G                           C
If you hear this song, know it’s meant for you,  
G                       D
Every song I sing is a piece of you.

[Chorus]
Em                C
Carry me over, wash me clean,  
G                   D
Take me back to where we’ve been.  
Em                 C
Every wrong, I’d make it right,  
G                      D
If love could turn the tide tonight.  

[Bridge]
C             D
  Money can’t buy the time,  
G                    Em
Gold won’t heal this heart of mine.  
       C               D
If the river flows her way,  
     G                D
I’d swim across, I’d beg her to stay.  

[Chorus]
Em                C
Carry me over, wash me clean,  
G                   D
Take me back to where we’ve been.  
Em                 C
Every wrong, I’d make it right,  
G                      D
If love could turn the tide tonight.  

[Final Chorus / Outro]
Em                      C
Carry me softly, let my soul be seen,  
G                      D
Turn back the pages to where we’ve been.  
   Em                  C
If I could heal what I broke that night,  
    G        D                 G
I’d hold you close and not let go tonight.
