Capo 3


=========================================
Lyrics & Chords
=========================================

[Verse 1]
Em
I traced your name in the frost on the glass
G               D/F#           Em
Watched it fade like the time we let pass
Em
Every word I spoke was a candle’s brief flame
G               D/F#           Em
And the wind just laughed, but I took the blame
Em
I walked the long road back to where we began
G               D/F#           Em
Counted the cracks in the lines on my hands
Em
Every mile was a story I couldn’t defend
G               D/F#           Em
Every turn was a truth I tried to bend

[Chorus]
G/C                       Dsus2/A
That’s what I get for making it up
G/C                                                      Dsus2/A
Painting the sky just to drink from an empty cup
G/C                                             Dsus2/A
I thought the story could keep us alive
            Dsus2/A                     Em
But the truth was a shadow I couldn’t survive

[Verse 2]
Em
I built us a house out of paper and rain
G               D/F#           Em
Each room filled with echoes that whispered your name
Em
Tried to turn midnight into a dawn
G               D/F#           Em
But the stars all fell before I could hold on
Em
I stitched the silence into songs you could hear
G               D/F#           Em
Hoping the melody might pull you near
Em
But every note was a thread that came loose
G               D/F#           Em
Every chord just reminded me of the truth

[Chorus]
(repeat as above)

[Bridge]
    G
And I can’t rewrite the lines I’ve torn
    D
The ink has bled, the page is worn
   Am
If I could speak, I’d say your name
        C
But the wind would steal it just the same
G
I see your face in the smoke and the rain
  D
A ghost in the glass, calling my name
    Am
But every time I reach, you are gone
     C
I’m left with the dark before the dawn

[Continue same chord progression, while singing "Before the Dawn"]

[Chorus]
(repeat as above)

[Outro]
Em
So I’ll trace your name one last time
G               D/F#           Em
Watch it fade in the frost, in the dim lamplight
Em
No more stories, no more disguise
G               D/F#           Em
Just the cold, and the truth, and the quiet night
