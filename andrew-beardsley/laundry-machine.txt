Blues in E  A  B7
----------------------------

I'M SITTIN HERE LISTEN
TO THE LAUNDRY GET CLEAN
WAIT FOR THE TRANSFER
TO THE DRYING MACHINE
I'LL HEAR THE NOISE
AND I KNOW IT IS TIME
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
IT'S LAUNDRY CHANGING TIME

I STILL DO HOCKEY STOPS
AROUND MY HOUSE
UP ON ONE FOOT
JUST LIKE A MOUSE
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
I'M NOT GETTIN' OLD
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
I'M NOT GETTIN' OLD

AT THE GROCERY STORE
WITH A WIRE-BASED CARRIAGE
LOOKIN FOR SOME PRODUCE
LOOKIN FOR SOME MARRIAGE
I PUT MY FEET UP
ON THE RAIL
AIN'T NO OLD MAN HERE
I AIN'T THAT FRAIL

DISHWASHER'S RUNNIN
FROM THE DINNER TONIGHT
HOPE THE BEEP DON'T WAKE ME UP TONIGHT
CAUSE I NEED TO SLEEP
THAT'S WHAT I NEED
MAYBE I AM AN OLD MAN
BUT NOT TONIGHT
