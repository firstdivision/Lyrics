Classic country song in G

      G                         
I WAS LOOKIN' ROUND' SEARCHIN FOR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE
  C
MY FRIENDS TOLD ME IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT
      C
DON'T FOLLOW THAT PERSON, IT'S AN UNKNOWN 
D
I THINK CRIME STATS ARE WAY OVERBLOWN

SO I WENT UP AND ASKED, FOR A COOL DRINK
YOU SEEMED TO PONDER, AND WONDER AND THINK
AND THEN TO MY JOY, YOU TURNED TO ME
AND SAID HERE KITTY KITTY, HERE KITTY

THAT WAS WHEN I KNEW, I HAD FOUND A FRIEND
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, IT JUST HAPPEND AND THEN
YOU PICKED ME UP AND TOLD ME I WAS SUCH A HANDSOME CAT
YOU TOOK ME HOME AND THEN THAT WAS THAT

[CHORUS]
     C
NOW I'M YOUR CAT, AND YOU'RE MY HUMAN
    G
DOMESTICATED, DON'T TRY TO EVADE IT
    C
YOU THOUGHT YOU SAVED ME, BUT I GOT SOME NEWS
D
I DON'T REALLY BELONG TO YOU

YOU BOUGHT ME A SPECIAL WATERING TREE
AND A MATCHING FOOD BOWL WITH PICTURES OF BEES
CARPET SHELVES ALL OVER THE WALLS
I'LL ADMIT IT DOES MAKE ME FEEL TALL

A BOX IN THE LAUNDRY WHERE I DO MY BIZZ
MULTIPLE TOYS FULL OF CATNIP
THE GOOD FOOD THAT COMES OUT OF A CAN
AND A TINY TREADMILL FOR A CAT-SIZED FRIEND

I SLEEP IN THE BED WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
I JUDGE YOU FROM THE DINING ROOM WHEN YOU'RE COOKIN
IF YOU'E LUCKY I'LL GRACE YOU WITH MY PRESENCE
BUT ONLY IF YOU KEEP BUYING ME PRESENTS

[CHORUS]

YOU....YOU BELONG TO ME
YOU....YOU BELONG TO ME, THAT'S RIGHT
YOU....YOU BELONG TO ME
YOU....YOU'RE ALL MINE
YOU....I GUESS I'LL LET YOU STAY
