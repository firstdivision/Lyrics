[Verse 1]
    Am
It started as a kitten
      C
Every week a new toy
  G
A lot of laughs and giggles 
            Am
It was the families joy

[Verse 2]
A few years later 
All it did was lounge 
Lots of lazy cuddles
It got a bit more round 

[Pre-Chorus]
But one thing remained 

[Chorus]

           C
It was the hair
     G
It’s everywhere. 
  Am
I swear I cleaned that cushion 
   C
I repainted the room
  G
I vacuumed umpteen times
    Am
But there it still is. 
               C
It’s All their hair. 
     G
It’s everywhere!


[Verse 3]
The kids went off to college
Their friend keeps watch with care
They’ll come home someday
To a cat still waiting there

[Verse 4]
Old and fragile
The cat was a blessing
Lots of tears and grief
But one thing was pressing

[Pre-Chorus]
Amongst the memories 

[Chorus]

Took a toothbrush to the grout
A scrubber to the baseboards 
I’m plagued by it. Can’t get rid of it
It’s all their hair
It’s everywhere. 
I miss them but not their hair
