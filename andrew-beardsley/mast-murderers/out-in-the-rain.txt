CHORDS:
E   Bm   A

[VERSE]
E                            Bm
SHE EMERGED LIKE A DROWN RAT IN MAINE
 A                                  E
NEVER SAW IT COMIN', THAT ELLSWORTH RAIN
BLURRY ROADS, HEAVENLY FALLS
POUNDING SOUNDS, GOING INSANE

FROM HEAD TO TOE SHE'S WET WITH RAGE
FUNNY HOW THE ENGINE FADES
THIS SCREECHING SHOWER CREATED
OH, SUCH AN EVERGLADE

[CHORUS]
A
SHE'S OUT IN THE RAIN
    E
AND IT'S POURING DOWN
    A
SHE'S OUT IN THE RAIN
       B
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF TOWN
 ....hold....       E                             
WON'T YOU GET ME TO RIGHT PLACE I GOTTA BE
          B
FIND ME A PLACE THAT'S WARM AND DRY
  A
A GLASS OF WHISKY AND A FIRE
B       A          E
SOUNDS JUST ABOUT RIGHT
 
[INTERLUDE - MINI SOLO]

[VERSE]
COLD AIR, AND CHANGING LEAVES
THEY FALL IN THE FALL, WHAT THE COLD AIR BRINGS
THE END OF SUMMER, BEGINNING OF SNOW
SOME MIGHT SAY, THEY LIKE THESE THINGS

BUT LIKE A BANSEE SHE CRIES, ON A COLD WINTER TRAIL
ROLLING ECHOS I HEAR...SHE BEGINS TO WAIL
HER FEET ARE COLD, HER HANDS ARE NUMB
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO BAIL

[CHORUS]
[LAST TWO LINES OF CHORUS]
