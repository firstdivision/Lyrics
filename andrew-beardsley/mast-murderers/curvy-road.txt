THE TWIST AND TURNS
MAKE MY STOMACH BURN
I HATE THIS STUPID ROAD

[ORIGINAL]
THE TALL MAJESTIC TREES
HAVE PRETTY LEAVES
AT LEAST THEY TELL ME SO

[SUGGESTED]
THE TALL MAJESTIC TREES
ONCE HAD PRETTY LEAVES
WILDFIRE BARED THEIR BRANCHES

I'VE GOT MY HEAD IN MY HANDS
TILL WE LEAVE THESE LANDS
I WISH I COULD GO TO SLEEEP

BUT I CAN'T GET NO SHUTEYE
NO MATTER HOW I TRY
WITH MY GUT FEELING SO WEAK

[INTRO CHORDS]
YEAAAAAH
HATE THIS ROAD
TOLD YOU SO

[BRIDGE]
GET ME OFF THIS ROAD
DON'T WANT TO GO
TOLD YOU SO
