[Chorus or pre chorus:]
I do not give two fucks
Work really sucks 
Day in and day out
The same shit always 

Beeping and ringing
My head has gone reeling 
I musta been a masochist 
Why did I even choose all this 
[chorus]

Verses: 
Terry hates your guts
Makes work life miserablé

The coffees always rank 
Don’t think of the dirty water tank

The ceiling has a leak
The rugs really reek

X I should play the lotto 

Bill said he’s Mike Tyson 
He bared his pearls at me
There’s blood everywhere 
I’m gonna pull my hair 

There’s family on the line
Do you have the time?

X I need to win the lotto

I may have peed my pants  
I can’t leave the floor
Now I have to poo 
What do I do

My legs are full of aches 
My head is full of pain
My postures getting worse 
My eyes are full of strain

X why can’t I win the lotto

Why are you picking your nose 
There’s tissues right there 
Where are those boogers being placed
Please lord not my face 

Did you say you committed crimes!?
Oh you’re worried about my enzymes. 
How loud can I talk 
I need to go for a walk

Chorus:
I do not give two fucks
Work really sucks 
Day in and day out
The same shit always 

Beeping and ringing
My head has gone reeling 
I musta been a masochist 
Why did I even choose all this
