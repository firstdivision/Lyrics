Title: The Peace Lily Math Problem

          C
THERE'S A PLANT IN THE CORNER
     G
IT'S GOT SOME YELLOW LEAVES
    G
AND IF I WERE TO COUNT THEM
        C
I WOULD SEE THAT THERE ARE THREE

  C
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WANTS
  G
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS
    G
BUT I HAVE GROWN QUITE ATTACHED TO IT
                     C
I WISH IT WOULD TELL ME

IT'S A LONG STORY OF MOVIN
ABOUT 14 YEARS AGO
I FOUND AN APARTMENT
AND A PEACE LILY TOO

THAT PLANT GREW AND GREW
AND THEN I BOUGHT A HOUSE
THE PLANT CAME WITH ME
A LITTLE OVERGROWN

SO I SPLIT IT INTO FOUR PIECES
AND PUT EACH IN THEIR OWN POT
THREE OF THOSE MADE IT
ONE OF THEM DID NOT

BUT THE THREE ARE STILL WITH ME
BUT THAT ONE IS STRUGGLING
MAYBE ALL IT NEEDS
IS JUST A LITTLE TRIM

MAYBE I SHOULD DO THE SAME THING
WITH ALL THREE PLANTS I HAVE
GO BUY A BUNCH MORE POTS
AND DIVIDE THEM ALL AGAIN

BUT THE MATH DOESN'T WORK
IT'S EXPONENTIAL
AT THIS RATE, I'LL PROPOGATE
ENGOUGH PLANTS TO FILL THE WORLD
