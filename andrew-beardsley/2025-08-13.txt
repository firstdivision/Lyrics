Should be played on capo 1, but for some reason it's not.
Capo zero baby.
Downtuned 1/2 step

                               A#                                 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHY I PLAYED ON THIS FRET
               F
MAYBE DECISION I'LL REGRET
                   A#
IF THERE REALLY IS SUCH A THING
                F
WHEN YOU LET AN INSTRUMENT RING
                D#
WHEN YOU PLAY TO-GETHER
                A#
SIX STRINGS AND MELODY
            D#
GET LOST IN FOREVER
        F
AND TRY TO FIND YOUR PEACE


MAYBE LOOKIN' FOR ANOTHER SONG
MAYBE ONE FROM TIME LONG GONE
WHERE DID THE WORDS AND THE MELODY GO?
THE SAME PLACE OLD MEMORIES GO?
FLIPPIN THROUGH MY SONGBOOK
YEAH I USED TO KNOW THAT ONE
MAYBE TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AND TRY TO RE-LEARN THAT ONE
