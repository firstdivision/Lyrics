WELL I DON'T KNOW WHY I PLAYED ON THIS FRET
               F
MAYBE DECISION I'LL REGRET
                   A#
IF THERE REALLY IS SUCH A THING
                F
WHEN YOU LET AN INSTRUMENT RING
                D#
WHEN YOU PLAY TO-GETHER
                A#
SIX STRINGS AND MELODY
            D#
GET LOST IN FOREVER
        F
AND TRY TO FIND YOUR PEACE

                  A#
MAYBE LOOKIN' FOR ANOTHER SONG
               F
MAYBE ONE FROM TIME LONG GONE
                            A#
WHERE DID THE WORDS AND THE MELODY HIDE?
                   F
THE SAME PLACE OLD MEMORIES DIE?

AND TRY TO RE-LEARN SOME
