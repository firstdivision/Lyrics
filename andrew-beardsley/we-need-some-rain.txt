Vocal "HASN'T" starts on second finger of the "G" chord.

  G
WELL IT HASN'T BEEN THIS HOT
      D
SINCE I CAN'T REMEMBER
     G
I'M WAITING PATIENTLY
	 C
FOR THE COOL OF NOVEMBER
G
WAITING FOR THE RAIN
  D              G
WAITING, FOR THE RAINS

LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY
WHEN I LOOK OUTSIDE
SEE A DARK STORM CLOUD
DRIFTING BY
GONNA BRING THE RAIN
IT'S GOTTA RAIN

[CHORUS]
THE LAKES ARE GETTING DRY
TREES ARE DYING
THE LAWNS ARE FRIED
FIRES START
ALONG THE ROADS
STAGE THREE RESTRICTIONS
OR SO I'M TOLD

G
WE NEED A GULF STORM
     D
JUST NOT ONE TOO BIG
G
JUST ENOUGH TO FILL THE DAM
C
LEAST A LITTLE BIT
G
BRING SOME RAIN
    D
WE NEED THE RAIN


I LEAVE WATER FOR THE BIRDS
AND THE TEXAS SPINEY HORNS
THEY'RE THIRSTY TOO
AND NEED SOME LOVE
WE NEED THE RAIN
WE NEED SOME RAIN
