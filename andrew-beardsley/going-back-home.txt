GOING BACK HOME - Andrew Beardsley - 2022-02-24
----------------------------

Capo 2

                     G
I've got the urge to move along
                     C
Been a while since I wrote a song
                    G
I wasn't quite sure what it was
                      D
But something started feeling wrong

                     G
But I think I got it figured out
                 C
Pretty sure without a doubt
                     G
I've gone and made a new plan
     D              G
And this is what it is

I'm gonna sell my house here
And buy another up there
short drive on a weekend
you're somewhere you've never been

You can hike in the mountains
You can swim in the salt waves
You can drink in the cities
You can be where you please (note: need better line)

[chorus / bridge]
Bm                       C5
    I have loved my time here
	                    G      D
but it's time for me to go
        Bm                C5
There's something calling me
           F
And I just need
    D
To  go
---------------------------------------------------

I'm goin back home soon
back to beaches and full moons
back where I grew up
back to people that I know well

I'm tired of this weather
the summer never ends here
there's cold but no snow though
I'm goin back home

[play soft]
But I'm not leaving my friends behind
That's the last thing from my mind
I want to show them all those things
That makes it special to me

Like walking though the fresh snow
Leaves in Autumn oh how they glow
The deep blue of the water
And the smell of spring flowers

[chorus / bridge]

[outro]
it's like when I left last time
I have a thought in my mind
When I get it I can't let it go
That's something that I know you know

I'm coming back home to you
The new thing that I have to do
I coming back home
I'm going home

I coming back home
I'm going home
