I'm just a simple
creature in this world
I was born, 
and everyone looked away

I had six strings
and shine like the rest
but I always knew
I wasn't the best

I heard rumors
they're going to send me away
to someplace
far away

But I'm not ready
I've got songs to sing
won't you let me
let these strings ring

[chorus]
'Cause I'm just a newborn
something fresh and new
Maybe not the brightest
but good at feeling blue

So let me stay down low
fly under the radar
Let me hide in this case
and live along with you
