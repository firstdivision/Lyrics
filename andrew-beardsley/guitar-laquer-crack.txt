C                                       C
PLAYIN' MY GUITAR AND I NOTICED SOMETHIN' WACK
F                       F
SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T GO BACK
G                                   G
I KEPT PLAYING MY BABY LIKE I DIDN'T CARE
    C                                                  C
BUT ALL MY ATTENTION WAS ON THE CRACK THAT SHOLDN'T BE THERE

    C                                       C
I'M LOOKIN AT THE FRETS WHILE I'M SINGIN' A SONG
F
WORRY MY SELF, THAT IT WON'T BE LONG
           G
BEFORE THE CRACK BECOMES A GULLY, IT FEELS QUITE CLEAR
   C7                                                 C7
MY GUITAR WILL SELF-DESTRUCT, AND I'LL WASTE ALL THIS BEER

[CHORUS]
       G
WHEN I GET FAMOUS AND THEY CALL MY NAME
  C                      C
I WANT TO HAVE MY GUITAR NEXT TO ME
            G
BUT THEY'LL WANT TO TAKE OUR PICTURE
         G
AND IT'S GONNA BE CLEAR
          C
THERE'S A CRACK IN THE LACQUER 
    C7
AND THEY'LL SEE IT RIGHT THERE

FEELIN MOROSE, COULDN'T GET LOWER THAN I
MY FRIEND WAS BREAKING UP, DON'T WANT TO SAY BYE
ALL THE NIGHT AND THE DAYS AND DRINKS AND THE SONGS
DON'T LEAVE HERE GUITAR, DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE

BUT THEN I TOOK A CLOSER LOOK AND REALIZED I WAS WRONG
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A CRACK WAS JUST DIRT ALL ALONG
I CLEANED AND TUNED AND POLISHED EVERYTHING THAT I COULD
AND BOY IF THAT GUITAR ID STILL LOOKING GOOD


[CHORUS]
       G
WHEN I GET FAMOUS AND THEY CALL MY NAME
  C                      C
I WANT TO HAVE MY GUITAR NEXT TO ME
        G
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE OUR PICTURE
         G
AND IT'LL BE FINE
          C
MY GUITAR IS LOOKIN' PRETTY
    C7
AND I'M DOING...ALL RIGHT





WHAT AM I TO DO, I DON'T KNOW

SHOULD I TAKE IT TO A LUTHIOR OR SO
        G
WHEN THE NEWSPAPER CALLS
      G
AND I GOTTA SEND A PHOTO BACK
  C
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
                 C
IT'S ONE WITH NO LAQUER CRACK
