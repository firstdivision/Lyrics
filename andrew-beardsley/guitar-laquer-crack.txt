C                                       C
PLAYIN' MY GUITAR AND I NOTICED SOMETHIN' WACK
F                       F
SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T GO BACK
G                                   G
I KEPT PLAYING MY BABY LIKE I DIDN'T CARE
    C                                      C
BUT ALL MY ATTENTION WAS ON THE CRACK THAT SHOLDN'T BE THERE

[CHORUS]
        G
WHEN THE NEWSPAPER CALLS
      G
AND I GOTTA SEND A PHOTO BACK
  C
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
                 C
IT'S ONE WITH NO LAQUER CRACK
