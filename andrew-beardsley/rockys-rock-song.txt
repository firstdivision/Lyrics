Song starts on palm muted C....

C
Peas and carrots
Peas and carrots
Peas and carrots

[CHORUS]
             C
Well it's a pretty good life
  A#
I can't complain
      F
I get fed real well
         C
And stay out of the rain

I love my frisbee
And I'm telling you
If you're throwing it for me
My best friend is you

But what i really want
Is what's in the fridges
It's the vegetables
The Peas and carrots

[CHORUS]

I like to run on the beach
And play in the waves
Sometimes I sit and stare
And contemplate

But if you're going outside
I'll be right next to you
I'll get the frisbee
and bring it to you

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
G        F
Peas and carrots
Chicken liver beef tuna too
Dishwasher's open, snack bar view
I might sneak a little of that too, but

[CHORUS]
