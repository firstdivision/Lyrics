"The Ballad of My Empty Bowl"
(Written and performed by Whiskers the Cat)

Verse 1
I woke up at three, ‘cause that’s when I dine,
You were asleep, but your leg looked divine.
So I used my claws to gently remind,
That breakfast time is not optional, kind.

Chorus
Where’s my food? Where’s my feast?
Why must I beg like a ravenous beast?
I’m a noble hunter, regal and whole,
Yet I’m crying alone at my empty bowl.

Verse 2
You bought me a toy, it squeaks like a mouse,
But I’d rather knock glassware all over the house.
You pet me, I purr, then bite without shame,
Don’t take it personal — it’s part of the game.

Chorus

Verse 3
You call it "counter," I call it my throne,
That sandwich you made? Well, it’s mine, not your own.
Your laptop is warm, your laundry’s my bed,
And whatever you’re eating — I want it instead.

Final Chorus
Where’s my food? Where’s my feast?
I’ll yowl and I’ll paw ‘til my hunger’s released.
You’re my loyal servant — that’s your only role,
Now get me some tuna and fill up my bowl!
