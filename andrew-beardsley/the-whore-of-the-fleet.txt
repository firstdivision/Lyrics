SHE CAME TO SWANS ISLSND 
CAUSE SHE WANTED 

TO COOK SOME LOBSTER 
BUT SHE DIDN’T HAVE ANY
SO SHE WENT A GOT A JOB 
AS A LOBSTER STERNMAN

WELL SHE WORKED ON ONE BOAT
AND THEN ANOTHER 
IT WASN’T VERY LONG 
'FORE EVERY CAPTAIN AND THEIR BROTHER 
WAS ASKING FOR THIS CITY SLICKER 
TO GIVE ‘EM A HAND

TO ACCOMPLISH ONE FEAT 
TO COOK ALL THE LOBSTER
