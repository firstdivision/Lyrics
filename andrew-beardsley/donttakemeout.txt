Blues feel

           E
You can’t leave me alone
in a house full of booze
                     B7
and not expect me to drink it

B7
The vodka’s on the door
The ice is very nice
                      E
Soda’s flat but I’ll take it

E
My cup runeth over
I lost my four leaf clover
                             B7
My hands are wet my lips are not

B7
I’m feeling kind of slow
a drifting country joe
                        E
I think I’ll do another shot


[chorus]
                  A
you can’t take me out
                   E
But don’t leave me in
                     B7
I’ve been known on a time or two
                  E
To have a little Gin

I saw you at the bar
And I knew my greatest fear
I knew that there was no way
I’d get you over here
[/chorus]

[inst]

I’m drinkin in my home
Textin’ on the phone
I knew that I shouldn’t but I did

Facebook and the twitter    <— sing all three lines as one long sentence
social network no hitter
shoulda taken that advice and left the grid

I pick up my guitar
wish I had a whammy bar
I don’t so six’ll have to make do

Brought out a pen and paper
couldn’t find my eraser
pretending’ that I’m playin’ in front of you

[chorus]
