[VERSE 1]
 E                A  
YOU MIGHT WANT A BEER OR TWO
    B7                  E
YOU MIGHT WANT A CHARDONNNEY
   E                        A
I GOT A PINT GLASS FULL OF FUN
       B7                 E
THAT'S WHY I MAKE IT THIS WAY

FOURTEEN OUNCES, I TIP MY CUP
THIS ONE'S GOING DOWN SMOOTH
A LITTLE LIME, NOT TOO MUCH ICE
A LITTLE ORANGE JUICE

[CHORUS]
LESS ICE MORE DRINK
LESS ICE MORE DRINK
GOT MORE DIRNK IN MY GLASS
LESS ICE MORE DRINK
LESS ICE MORE DRINK
THIS ONE'S KICKIN MY ASS

[VERSE 2]
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR JELLO SHOTS
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SIDECARS
THE DRINK THAT I HAVE WITH ME
YOU CAN'T FIND IN BARS

IT'S HEAVYWEIGHT, IT'S PROFESSIONAL
IT'S AT THE TOP OF THE ROOF
THERE'S NOT MUCH WATER IN HERE
PRETTY MUCH 40 PROOF

[BRIDGE]
       A
LET'S HAVE MORE DRINKS
     B7
LETS HAVE MORE FUN
      E                A
WE'LL KEEP THEM ON THE RUN
     A            B7
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR ICE
               E
I'LL KEEP THIS GLASS

[VERSE 3]
THERE'S A BAG OF CHIPS, CALLING MY NAME
THERE'S A BLUE BOX OF MAC AND CHEESE
IF I CAN FIND A MICROWAVE
THEN I CAN HAVE A 'NOTHER ONE OF THESE

[CHORUS / OUTRO]
[CHORUS]
LET'S HAVE MORE DRINKS
LET'S HAVE MORE DRINKS
LESS ICE IN OUR GLASS
LET'S HAVE MORE DRINKS
LET'S HAVE MORE DRINKS
NO ICE IN OUR GLASS
