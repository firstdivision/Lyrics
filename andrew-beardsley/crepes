Snow is coming down
turn that frown upside down
making crepes on my stove
this is a treasure trove

cooking and looking outside
the weather is dreary and the snow fly
the food is better inside anyway
don’t see why I should do anything

Are the snow plows running
grating and slushing
did it rain yet, or has it iced and that
is it light and fluffy
did you shovel
LIKE YOUR CREPES!
LIKE YOUR CREPES!
AND YOUR WHIP
AND YOUR WHIP


I’m basically Eminem
sitting ‘round and Causing Mayhem
Regretting my rhyme scheme
double A.  double B

Your drink is half empty
bacon and eggs I see
what’s with the rabbit food
breakfast came unglued
that’s not a real man’s food
