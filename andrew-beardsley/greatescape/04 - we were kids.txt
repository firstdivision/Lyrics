Capo 3
Asus  D  E


The pain of ankle turned wrong
The sneeze of a fresh cut lawn
in mid July

We were kids back then
sleeping in a two man tent
with a big flashlight

The smell of a baseball mitt
The first time you heard --shit--
come out of your mouth

And we were kids back then
when the world was full of friends
that would spend the night

A peck on the cheek
From the girl down the street
Didn't wash it off

And we were kids back then
But we wanted to pretend
it was love

Go climb that old pine tree
come down and skinned your knee
like they said you would

We were kids back then
When a bruise was a trophy
to defend

A faceplant off your bike
The first time on a hike
with your old man

And we were kids back then
Hanging out with the men
and we ruled the world
