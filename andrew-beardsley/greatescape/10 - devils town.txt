We got a freight train barlin down
drowning out the sins of this Devil's Town
the stench of loser lingers around
the tracks run through, but there's no way out

[chorus]
the accents might change
ruseted trucks all look the same
lotto ticket, and a beat up dame
a vacant room to hide the shame

too many rifles and not enough prey
too many bills an not enough pay
too many memories and too much pain
that's why she needs to stay

[chorus]

lawn full of trash and self defeat
an hour from nowhere on a dead end street
ragged kids and broken machines
prison ain't as bad as it seems

[chorus]
