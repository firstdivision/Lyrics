Tried to write a song for you 
Something sad, slow and blue

But as I sat with this strumming pen
I had no beginning nor and end

Then I realized what it was I had done
Tried to write sad
When it should have been fun

You live on in the memories
the stories and the dreams
the hearts thoughts and minds you left behind

even though it's been a while
a picture always brings a smile
in my heart here to stay
why'd you have have to go away

oh, forever, we'll remember
all those little things you used to do
oh you know it's true

don't forget 
never let
these things
bother you
we remember
we remember you

even though it's been a while
you're picture always a smile
in my heart here to stay
why'd you have to go away

even though it's been a while
you're picture always a smile
in my heart here to stay
why'd you have to go away
