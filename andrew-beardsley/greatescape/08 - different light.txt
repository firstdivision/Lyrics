C                    WG
I thought you might see
                    WGm
me in a different light
                   F
I thought just one time
  Fm
--you --
                C
would spend the night

the wound doesn't heal
quite the same
and all that echoes though my heart
is your name

but now I'm giving up
on this crazy love
I think I've had enough
had enough
of this crazy love

I thought one day
you would wake up
I thought you'd be in love
--friends--
just wasn't enough

The night doesn't feel quite the same
and all that matters is you
never changed
