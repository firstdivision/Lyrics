I SHOULD GET ANOTHER ONE BUT
THAT'S PROBOBLY NOT THE
SMART THING
TO DO (ALREADY HAD TWO)

BUT I HAVEN'T HAD WHISKEY
STOCKED IN THE HOUSE
FOR OVER A MONTH

I GIT GIN
I GOT RHUM
I GOT EVERYTHIN
UNDER THE SUN

(HE SAYS)
BUT I LIKE DRIUNKING WHISKEY


I GOT LIGHT BEER
I GOT WHITE CLAW
I GOT CUTWATER
I'D RATHER DRINK REAL WATER

I GOT RED WINE
I GIT WHITE
I GOT CHAMPAGNE
OK, I'LL TAKE THAT PAIN

THE MOON IS SHINING
I GOT ME SOME STILL SHINE
NOW WE'RE GETTING TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE BARREL

BUT AT THE END IF THE DAY
NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY
I'D RATHER BE DRINKING WHISKEY
