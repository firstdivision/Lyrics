[Verse 1]

G                  Em
 Let me tell you a story
 C                  G         C
About an old friend   of mine
G         D/F#          Em           D
 Somebody left her in a shopping cart
      C                  D
 In a parking lot for us   to find
G                   Em
 Just a fuzzy black pup
        C                  G     C
She was hungry and feeling alone
G                  Em
 We put her in the back seat
    C                       G        
And told her we were taking her home

[Chorus]
G           Bm
Run, Maggie run
         C                G      C/G
With the heart of a rebel child
    G           Bm
Oh, run, Maggie run
           C               G       C
Be just as free as you are   wild

[Verse 2]
G           Em
 A few kids later
   C            G           C
We moved out on   the farm
G        D/F#           Em            D
 And she followed those kids around
           C              D
 Yeah, she kept them safe   from harm
G                       Em
 And she loved to chase squirrels
    C              G            C
And playing out in   the snow
G                      Em
 She'd take off like a bullet
    C                      G       C
Man,  you should have seen her go

[Chorus]
G           Bm
Run, Maggie run
         C                G      C/G
With the heart of a rebel child
    G           Bm
Oh, run, Maggie run
           C               G        C
Be just as free as you are   wild

[Verse 3]
G                    Em
 It was raining on a Monday
    C               G      C
The day that Maggie died
G         D/F#            Em      D
 She woke up and couldn't use her legs
     C            D
So I laid down by   her side
G                       Em
 She put her head on my hand
           C            G       C
Like she'd done so many times
G                     Em
 I told her she was a good dog
     C          G         C
Then I told her goodbye


[Chorus]
G           Bm
Run, Maggie run
         C                G      C/G
With the heart of a rebel child
    G           Bm
Oh, run, Maggie run
           C               G
Be just as free as you are   wild

[Verse 4]
G            Em
 I had a revelation
       C             G    C/G
As the tractor dug a hole
G      D/F#           Em   D
 I can tell you right now
        C   D
 That a dog has a soul
G                   Em
 And I thought to myself
      C             G
As we buried her on   the hill
G                  Em
 I never knew me a better dog
      C         G        C/G
And I guess I never will

[Chorus]
G           Bm
Run, Maggie run
         C                G
With the heart of a rebel child
    G           Bm
Oh, run, Maggie run
           C              G     C
Be just as free as you are wild
    G    D/F#        Em   D
Oh, run, Maggie run
         C                G       C/G
With the heart of a rebel child
    G           Em
Oh, run, Maggie run
           C               G
Be just as free as you are   wild
