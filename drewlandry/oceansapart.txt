Oceans Apart 
               Em
For weeks at a time
                 C
the winners will lose, again
                D
the losers will die

Wrote it on paper
Worked it out in my mind
wasted my living
on gettin' things right

Who says you loved me
Baby that was untrue
Still ain't no reason
I can't love you

Oceans apart

[inst]

You were a good girl
The best that you, could
Won't call you hi lo
wouldn't miss understood

He ain't no love song
I can make it all right
A reason to hold on
another dark night

Oceans apart

[inst]

You tried to take off
Holdin my head, again
don't mind your borrow
but I need it, back

I ain't a bad man
You're a sweethearted, girl
You were in my town
My side of the world

Oceans apart
for years at a time
The losers will win, someday
the winners will die

Cause there ain't no rainbow
It's the end of, the mind
Don't you get lonely
Just to get by-aii-ai

Oceans apart
