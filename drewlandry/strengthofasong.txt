Strength of a song
and the words don't belong
not to you or to me
and the good lord's to keep

blood in my veins
only memories remain
with the dirt on my feet
you know the fore you'll be me

With dreams left behind
there's a place in your mind
we could take you back home
on the strength of a song

[inst]

The love that we made
even times that we erase
underneath there's a shade
still a spade is a spade


Goals left behind
like a child you will find
They can take you back home
on the strength of a song
