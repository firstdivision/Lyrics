[Verse 1]
     G    G7              C             Cm
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
         G            Em7      A7        D7
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
             G        G7           C                    Cm
Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,
      G           B7    Em7            A7       D7      G   D/F#
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
 
[Chorus]
          Em                Bm
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy,
       C                    G
She'll beat you if she's able,
             Em7                C                G   D/G  D/F#
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
       Em               Bm                    C              G
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
        Em            A7             Am7
But you only want the ones you can't get
 
[Verse 2]
D    G   G7             C          Cm
Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger,
     G              Em7            A7           D7
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
    G      G7              C              Cm
And freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
     G      B7  Em7                 A7        D7    G   D/F#
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
 
[Chorus]
           Em                   Bm
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
    C                      G
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
     Em7              C                   G   D/F#
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
       Em              Bm
You're losin' all your highs and lows
         C             G             Am7  Am7add11  D
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away
 
[Verse 3]
     G   G7              C              Cm
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
     G         D/F#  Em   A7              D7
Come down from your fences, open the gate
          G      G7               C                 Cm
It may be rainin',  but there's a rainbow above you
           G       B7    Em       C       G/B   Am7
You better let somebody love you (let somebody love you)
           G       B7    Em        D             G
You better let somebody love you before it's too late
