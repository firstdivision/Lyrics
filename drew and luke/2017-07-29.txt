[verse 1]
This American dream
that y'all been living 
ain't the bullshit hand me down
that I've been given

Got the ped o philiac living next-door
and the gal downstairs 
is a first class whore
and no one cares

[CHORUS]
The painter's face 
is the one that shows what's real
Digging in and showing
beneath what you feel

The layers underneath 
the canvas
shows what's real
Whatever, let's go there

[verse 2]
Mistakes and the memories
have no meaning
history and the past 
is repeating

Long barell sent
short sighted
incensed but delighted
always running
and frightened
