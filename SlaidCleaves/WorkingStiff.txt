Where do all the sailors go, when there ships don’t come in
They’re all working in a five foot box, filing folders, punching clocks

What became of whats her name, she could sing like a bird                            
Someone said that she was getting out, cleaned up her mess and then she headed south


Em             B            Cm         A
And I always thought I would be somebody
Em             B            Cm        A
And I never thought it would come this
Em             B              A      Am
Now I’m just another working stiff


Where did all the day dreams go, I only know that they're gone
Just another of the things I’ve lost and now I mind my manners when I’m talking to the boss

Because I always thought I would be somebody
And I never thought it would come to this
Now I’m just another working stiff
