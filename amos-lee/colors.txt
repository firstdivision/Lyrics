[Verse]
G            Em    C           D     Dsus4
   Yesterday I got lost in the circus
G                Em     C     D     Dsus4
   Feelling like such a mess
G          Em            C              D     Dsus4
   Now I'm down I'm just hanging on the corner
G                   Em       C     D     Dsus4
   I can't help but reminisce


[Chorus]
               Am    G     D
   When you're go----------ne all the colors fade
               Am    G     D
   When you're go----------ne no New Year's Day parade
       Am     G    D
   You're go-------ne
Dsus4             G    Em    C    D  Dsus4
   Colors seem to fade

 
[Verse]
G            Em              C                       D     Dsus4
   Your mama called she said that you're down stairs crying
G               Em     C     D     Dsus4
   Feeling like such a mess
G              Em         C                 D     Dsus4
   Yeah I hear you you're in the background bawling
                 G       Em    C          D     Dsus4
   What happened to your sweet summertime dress

Em           A    Em             A
   I know we all, we all got our faults
          Em            A             D
   We get locked in our vaults and we stay

[Chorus]
                   Am    G     D
   But when you're go----------ne all the colors fade
               Am    G     D
   When you're go----------ne no New Year's Day parade
          Am    G     D     Dsus4   D
   You're go----------ne
                  G   Em   C   D   Dsus4
   Colors seem to fade
   D              G   Em   C       G
   Colors seem to fade     Yeah
