[Verse 1]

G
Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
Em
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
Cmaj7   C
It’s hard
G
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
     Em
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
   Cmaj7 C       D
So far from the stars


[Pre-Chorus]

Am7                      D
  And I want to tell you everything
                  G              D/F#        Em
The words I never got to say the first time around
Am7              D
  And I remember everything
                      G                   D/F#     Em
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
                          C
Wish I was there with you now


[Chorus]

       Em
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
      Cmaj7
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
G
Over and over the only truth
Em   D           G       C
Everything comes back to you
Em  D G
Mmm-mm-mm


[Verse 2]

  G
I saw that you moved on with someone new
       Em
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
     Cmaj7   C
It’s so hard
   D
So hard


[Pre-Chorus]

Am7                      D
  And I want to tell you everything
                  G              D/F#        Em
The words I never got to say the first time around
Am7              D
  And I remember everything
                      G                   D/F#     Em
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
                          C
Wish I was there with you now


[Chorus]

       Em
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
      Cmaj7
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
G
Over and over the only truth
Em   D           G       C
Everything comes back to you
    G
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
     Em
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Cmaj7
Over and over the only truth
Em   D           G       C
Everything comes back to you
Em  D G
Mmm-mm-mm


[Bridge]

Em                     D/F#
  And I know that it’s wrong
                  G
That I can’t move on
                            C
But there’s something about you


[Chorus]

       Em
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
      Cmaj7
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
G
Over and over the only truth
Em    D           G       C
Everything comes back to you
    G
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
     Em 
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Cmaj7
Over and over the only truth
Em   D           G       C
Everything comes back to you
Em  D G
Mmm-mm-mm
Em   D           G       C
Everything comes back to you
Em  D G
Mmm-mm-mm
