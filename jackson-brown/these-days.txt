[Intro]
C G/B Am7  G Fmaj9 x2

[Verse]
     C    G/B      Am7  G Fmaj9
Well I've been out walkin'
            C  G/B       Am7      G     Fmaj9
And I don't do that much talking, these days
      C  G
These days
      F
These days I seem to think a lot
                                  C       G  E7/G#
About the things that I forgot to do, for you
    Am                    Fmaj9
And all the times I had a chance to

[Verse]
     C G/B   Am7  G Fmaj9
Well I had a lover
        C       G/B   Am7    G       Fmaj9
It's so hard to risk another these days

These days
    F
Now if I seem to be afraid
                                     C   G E/G#

To live the life that I have made in song
     Am                             Fmaj9
Well it's just that I have been losing, so long

[Verse]
      C    G/B     Am7  G Fmaj9
Well, I'll keep on movin', moving on
           C        G/B  Am7     G     Fmaj9
Things are bound to be improvin' these days
             C   G
One of these days
      F
These days I sit on corner stones
                                       C       G      E/G#

And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend
         Am       Em          Fmaj9
Don't confront me with my failures
                      C G/B Am7  G Fmaj9
I had not forgotten them
