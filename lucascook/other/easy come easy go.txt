You bring the whiskey
and I'll bring the beer
pack up the guitars
we'll disappear

roll up a number
better make it two or three
head on up to the country
where life is easy

[chorus]
Cause I got a ramblin fever
Come to stay and drink
bottle won't let me down
I don't think

I'm a rhinestone cowboy
on a honky tonky road
I ain't livin life like this
easy come easy go
easy come easy go

[intro]

Bossman hollern' at me
   [ ??? ]
put on your favorite boots
and your favorite jeans

I know a cabin
way out in the sticks
pick out old country songs
we'll get our kicks

[chorus]
Cause I got a ramblin' fever
and I can stay and drink
bottle won't let me down
Jack Danials if you please

I'm a rhinestone cowboy
on a honky tonky road
I ain't livin long like this
easy come easy go
easy come easy go

[solo / i.e. verse

[chorus]
Cause I got a ramblin' fever
and I can stay and drink
bottle won't let me down
Jack Danials if you please

I'm a rhinestone cowboy
on a honky tonky road
I ain't livin long like this
easy come easy go
easy come easy go

[1/2 of verse and then outro]
You bring the whiskey
and I'll bring the beer
pack up the guitars
we'll disappear
