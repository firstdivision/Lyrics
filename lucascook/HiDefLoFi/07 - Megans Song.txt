Megan's Song
--------------------------------------


"D walkdown" - play through verses
D - D/C - D/B - D/C


Cat, kitty cat. She got a black kitty cat
She said that's where it's at
And a crystal dolphin around her neck
That she got in Florida
When her mom got married

Her name is Meagan

And that, black, kitty cat, 
Is the only one that
Little girl can tell the truth to
Just tell the truth you

     D/F#       D/E
The truth shall set you free.

Black kitty cat, they'll be best friends forever
Her and that black kitty cat
And that man, and that cruel game he plays
And everything that he takes away
He will pay back
To her and that black kitty cat
Her and that black kitty cat
Her and that black kitty cat


     D/F#       D/E
The truth shall set him free
