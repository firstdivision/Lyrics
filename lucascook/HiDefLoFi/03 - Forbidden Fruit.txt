Forbidden Fruit
------------------------------

              A
You can go to country

D             A
Sit down by a peach tree
D           A
Unwind to a day dream
D          A
Fantasy of you and me

                  D
I could enter the promised land
         A
Take you by the hand
            E
But unfortunately
                          A
You're forbidden fruit to me

And what you want to do
I can see it in your eyes
Feel it in your touch
And when I make you blush

You can make the first move
I proimise I'll be good
But unfortunately 
You're forbidden fruit to me

And it don't seem fair
That I should have to wait
You're already here
All the things I need

I'll bet that juice is sweet
Comin' down from the peach tree
But unfortunately
You're forbidden fruit to me

We can take out time
Savor the feeling
But unfortunately
You're forbidden fruit to me
