Coming Back to Me
------------------------------------

Capo 7

E    
She knows the words to my songs and
even when she forgets she'll 
       B
still sing along
                     E
she's got a heart of gold

And when I look into her eyes
I know she's still thinkin' 
              B
of that other guy
              E
It just takes time


         Asus
But I've lived and loved 
     E
and lost it all
Asus                      E
Scraped my wrists just to catch my fall
   Asus
I wear my heart too much
       B
on my sleeve

Search my life Lord only knows
how far and wide this river flows
The only thing I ever wanted to see
Comin' back to me

I know I've been wrong before
Taken advantage
Been walked out the door
And never look back

But maybe I've learned some lessons by now
Opened my heart and just stopped trying 
Just tryin' to be me

So I can play it cool and we'll be friends
It's better no matter what in the end
To Live and love and set your soul free

Don't stop givin' keep on tryin
Comon lady don't deny it
The opnly thing I ever wanted to see
Comin' back to me
