Days Gone By
--------------------------------------


Capo 3

E  E/F#  A  B

E    E/F#  A
Days gone by while I'm alone in this room
E        E/F#           A
I cannot seem to get my grip

E              E/F#           A
Please tell me where I put my car keys
  E             E/F#        A
I feel my mind starting to slip

Days gone by another minute older
I guess that's better than a kick

In my pants is where I left my car keys
I think my mind is playing tricks

B 
Playing tricks on me 
anyway you see it's an possible situation
A
and the freak in my suddenly is 
writhing with suggestion
B
Leading me to dream
                E   E/F#  A
of memories of days gone by
