I have nothing left to give you
I have nothing in reserve
My tank is running empty
It's more than I deserve

I need some kind of energy
An idea for a song
A prompt to be creative
It's been too long

[chorus]
Skills fade away
Complacence sets in
If you don't practice every day
There's no magic cure for this
Keep on keepin on
Even if it's the same old chords
One more time

[solo]

Where do songs come from?
they just kinda show up
when you're sitting there 
playing on the couch

They just kind of arrive
doing there own thing
and they say, hey man! 
do you want to go and record tonight?

[chorus]
And we say maybe we do 
and maybe we dont
maybe we won't  get all the way through
but we try the best we can
and all we have in the end
is what we can do

[verse]
so I'm sitting here tonight
with my bass guitar with four strings
just trying to find a melody or two

I m sitting here tonight
with my bass guitar with four strings
just trying to find a melody or two

[chorus]
and if it works out
I'll never know
and if I can find one
I will try again
I'll do the best I can 
I'll do what I can 
the best I can 
is good enough

[solo]
