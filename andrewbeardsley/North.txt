F        C     F           C
Have you ever wanted to go sailing?
         Am   Dm             G
Have you ever just slipped away?
C          F          C
I have and I miss the freedom
   Am       Dm           G
Of knowing where I will go


It's not the place it's the journey
It's the single point of mind
It's the trust in ship and crew
And knowing exactly what to do

[chorus]
Am     F           C
And if you were to ask me
And if you'll belive me
I will try to show you
Am                     D
Here's what you should know

Am             F              C
Look down, the needle's still North
No need to try and change course
Keep the rudder amidships and true
      Am                   Dm     G
Soon enough you'll be here too   ohhhh


When sails fill, you can feel it
It starts down in your toes
The rest shortly does follow
Raw power pushing you foward

One with the wind and the water
One with the wheel in your hand
One with the boat and your dreams
Together crossing the seas

[chorus]
