Carpe Aura
Around St John and
All the good spots
Swimming off of rocks

The moorings and anchors
The taxis and beaches
Painkillers and coronas
are going down smooth

[chorus]
Oh Carpa Aura
Don't you think we oughta
Meet up some time again
And sail away with friends

Carpe Aura 
Take me to shore or
out to sea
Can't ask for any more
[/chorus]

Full roast in the oven
Many meals together
Pastas and salads 
Gotta love this weather

We're making water and AC
This mooring ball is janky
But the wind has laid down well
Let's play more JJ Cale

[chorus]

I see a turtle swimming
and a manta right behind
let's jump into the dinghy
and dive right off the side

I've bought so many t-shirts
Hot sauces and pictures
The topping lift might be gone
It happened close to dawn

[chorus]
[last half chorus]
