Well when I bought bought this house
       C
I thought it would be just fine
         D
Gave the bank a pile of money
                      G
Now this house is all mine

She needed a lot of work
that's why I didn't pay a lot
Little did I know
Pretty much everything was shot

There's a water leak in the yard
Popcorn ceilings need to go
Irrigation hasn't worked
Since fifteen years ago

The rugs are full of pet stains
And the walls are brown and green
I'm starting to realize
this is the worst house I ever seen

But she's my little homestead
She keeps me warm and dry
I got rid of that ugly paint
Sat on the floor and watched it dry

I scraped off the popcorn
And built a brand new set of stairs
Put in fancy hardwood flooring
Now this place aint so bad

It's amazing what area rugs can do
That's something that I learned
Sometimes to the best lessons
come from getting burned

There's still a lot left to go
Like kitchen and bathroom
But now I know, with what I know
It's something I can do
