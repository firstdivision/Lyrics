She was a blonde haired beauty

A Lone Star cutie

In the sideview giving a wink


[wait]


She was stuck in traffic

a country song blasting

with a shiner bock taking a sip


[wait]


Nearly ran me over

When she pulled to shoulder

Boy let me give you a lift.


then I realized...

Girls drive trucks too.


She was a jean short wearin'

bikini top strain'

me straight in the eyes


She was the pride of texas

singing all my exes

with a beer between her thighs


Nearly keeled right over

when she touched my shoulder

boy give me a kiss


Girls drive trucks too.

Well the curves got tighter

She gave me a lighter

what was I to do


She was shifting gears

Singing in my ears

Let's get drunk and screw


Nearly fell right over

when she said she was older

than any girl that I knew
