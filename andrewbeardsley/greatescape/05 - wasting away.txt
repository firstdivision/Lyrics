Sitting here wasting away
Heard its your wedding day

Think of the places,
Remember the faces you
used to make

Inside my own mind too long
Everyone else moved on

Remember the dances
Think of the chances I 
gave to you

When everyday's the same
Nothing ever changes

My heart retraces
empty spaces where
footprints used to be

Came down the mountain to find
All the things I left behind

The sand is moving
I am losing time
I can't take back
