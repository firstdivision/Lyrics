E      A        E          A
drive into the sunset boy
E            A            E          A
remember the reasons for leaving
in every mile keep beliving
the road will silence all the noise

drag yourself into the city boy
you know the drugs they're dealing
forgive the man there sleeping
he's just drunk and unemployed

walk into the prison boy
forget the lies you been feeding
where every step is defeating
the life you once enjoyed

so, drive into the sunset boy
remember the reasons for leaving
in every mile keep beliving
the road will silence all the noise
the road will silence all the noise
