Lyrics
----------------------------------------------------------------
C   
Woke up this morning just starin' at the sky
C
Lyin' in my bed just a'wonderin' why
G
why can't I find what I seem to need
G
Why is my life so full of weeds.


Been lookin' for years, for piece of mind
A slice this earth that I can call mine
A few pepper plants, a couple peach trees
this world wasn't made for men like me
 
                        F
Yeah...I got plenty of friends...
                C
But I've got no home.

(instrumental)

Can't keep livin' with an empty heart
Rusty and broken, gonna fall apart
How much longer can I last this way
How much longer can I laugh it away

Watching my life come slowly undone
Time's one thing you can never outrun
For so long I thought I had a plan
The boy has grown, this child is a man

Yeah...I got plenty of friends...
But I've got no home.

(instrumental)
(walk down)
[bridge - modulate]
I've had things I wanted to go for,
Most of those have been kicked out the back door,
It's been a blast, and I've had fun,
But I feel like I lost more than I won

(de-modulate)
I got plenty of friends...
But I've got no home.
