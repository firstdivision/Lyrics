High tide and green grass forever
I don’t think I’ve ever
seen such golden light
‘gonna be a real good night

probably have a fire in the backyard
just around sunset it’ll start
burning off the trimmins from the trees
As long as there ain’t much breeze.

[Chorus]
Gonna have a fire in the backyard
Gonna burn it long and burn it hot
Don’t worry about the wood pile
we’ve got a lot
And the fire
will be smoking in the morning

Next morning, we all go fishing
Some’ll be hungover and wishing
they had not stayed so long
But that decision was long ago

Some will be catching fish
Or faking they had a hit
Some’ll be sleeping in the bow
We’re all drinking by noon anyhow

[chorus 2]
So bring on the boats
Bring on the parade
Bring on Block Island once again
Don’t put down your glass
Make it disappear fast
‘Cause the anchors weigh in the morning.
