WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER SNOWFLAKES
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER
CUT 'EM OUT AND TAPE THEM UP
FROM OUTSIDE, LOOKS LIKE IT'S SNOWING

SITTING AROUND THE TABLE
COMPARING WHAT WE MADE
CONGRATULATE EACH OTHER
SMILE, LAUGH, MAKE ANOTHER

[CHORUS]
THIS HOLIDAY LET'S GET TOGETHER
LETS HAVE A PARTY, FOR THE AGES
TABLES OF FOOD AND GOOD TIMES
ONE FOR THE FAMILY PAGES
[/CHORUS]

CHRISTMAS EVE IS MAGIC AS A CHILD
SOMEHOW WE GO TO SLEEP
OUR HEARTS AND MINDS WERE RUNNING
TO SEE, WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS

I'VE NEVER BEEN A PARENT
BUT I HAVE BEEN A CHILD
I STILL APPRECIATE THE WONDER
AND THE MAGIC INVOLVED

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]
LET'S GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE
AND MAYBE, ANOTHER DESSERT OR TWO
JUST FIVE MINUTES TO CATCH UP
THAT'S ALL I ASK OF YOU

IT'S LATE NOW, WE HAVE TO GET READY
THERE'S MORE PRESENTS, TO WRAP
JUST FIVE MORE AND WE CAN SLEEP
FOR TWO HOURS 'FORE THEY WAKE

[CHORUS]
[OUTRO]
