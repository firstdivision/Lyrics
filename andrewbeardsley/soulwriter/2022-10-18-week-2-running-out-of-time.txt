[V1]
Well I know you had some plans
to do something fun
But I'm here to tell you
you ain't gonna have none

I'm crashing your party
I'm giving you more chores
Things to do around the house
things that require stores

[CHORUS]
I'm your life
I'm coming for you
Don't think you're gonna relax much
Don't try and sleep through

I'll never let you rest
I'll never let you be
Try as you might
You'll never get away from me

[V2]
Cause the car insurance due
Don't forget your job
Wake up early every day
Cook a breakfast good and hot

And do all your laundry
And fold it all too
Clean out the gutters
Don't forget to shop for food

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE / INST]

[V3]
I always appear
when you try to do something fun
Here comes Old Grumpy Life
keepin you on the run

It's time to mow the lawn
The car needs an oil change
Running you out of time
is the special of the day
