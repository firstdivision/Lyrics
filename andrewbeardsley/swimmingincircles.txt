G                                                           D
staring out the window at a bird upon the lake

                                                                 G
he's swimin' in circles thinkin' he made a mistake

                                                                            C
he's searching but not finding for what he seems to need

                   G             D                       G
even natur it seems is always filled with greed

ants marching one by one just another day
single file traffic jam just to get some pay
strip the leaves and take them home sock it all away
even nature it seems is always filled with greed

[chorus]
C                                G
We're all swimming in circles

C                                        G
just trying to peek under the water

C                             G
we're all searching for another,

                        D
another place to go

big cat, small dog they think they're number one
what they don't know is no one cares where they just came from
the other cats and dogs, they could not care less
even nature it seems is always filled with greed

old fish, new bait hanging on a line
he just ate but what the hey, lets eat one more time
now he's in a cooler on some ice, someone else's meal
even nature it seems, is always filled with greed.

We're all swimming in circles
just trying to peek under the water
we're all searching for another,
another place to go
