I’m sitting here alone
I don’t want to be the loud guy
I’ll wait my turn
to be the one in front

If it takes ten years
I will still be here
Six strings
and a melody for me

I’ll wake up, and work
and do the things I need
I’ll walk the stairs
and make songs nobody needs

I’ll be up, in the morning
and pretend I love it
but the truth is
I hate it all

[chorus]
We all pretend we’re somewhere else
we all think we’re on our way
we like to think we’ve got a plan
but who can say
and who can plan past today
