I could have sworn it was Friday
because it was early Thursday
when I finally went to sleep.

I was up late drinkin
feeling and thinking
and suddenly it was half past three

I took a look at a new beer
thankfully my head cleared
and instead I rustled up some food

It was nothing special
just something easy and fast
also known as comfort food
