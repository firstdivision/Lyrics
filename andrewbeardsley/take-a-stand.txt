            G
ANOTHER DAY PASSES
   C        G
WE HAD OUR LAST DANCE
              G
WE LOVED EACH OTHER
                D   
WHEN TIMES WERE TOUGH

             G
SO I'LL KEEP WALKIN
     C       G
I'LL KEEP ON TALKIN
         G
AND I'LL REMEMBER
D              G
  YOUR ENDLESS LOVE


[CHORUS]
            C
AND IF I'VE FAILED YOU
                G
WONT YOU LET ME KNOW IT
               G
BECAUSE I CANT CHANGE
          D
WITHOUT A PLAN

            C
I NEED MORE GUIDANCE 
            G
I NEED YOUR PATIENCE
            G
I NEED YOUR STRENGTH
D            G
   TO MAKE A STAND

[/CHORUS]


I'VE SOME PAINFUL
MEMORIES AND ANGER
BUT IVE GOT MY HEALTH
HOW CAN I COMPLAIN

I'VE GOT SO MUCH TIME THAT
I SIT AND THINK ABOUT IT
I WONDER IF I'LL EVER
FEEL THE SAME AGAIN

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

I KNOW WHAT YOU'D SAY TO ME
YOU BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
KEEP A STEADY HAND

BUT YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS 
A PHONE WITH NO SERVICE 
HOW CAN A PLANE WITH NO WINGS 
BE AFRAID TO LAND

[CHORUS]
[OUTRO]
