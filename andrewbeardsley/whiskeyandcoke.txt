E   A   B7   (I  IV  V)

Country Rockabilly Roadhouse feel
E    
I’m spinning’ on my barstool like a bicycle spoke
E
Tappin’ on my cigarette and blown’ out smoke
A                                           E
I’m hoping’ - that my tab won’t make me broke
             B7                   A                    E
I’m drinking whiskey and whiskey,      and whiskey and coke

Country girl walked up to me and gave my arm a poke
Said ‘you aught to dance with me’, hey that’s a funny joke
I’m hoping, I’m still sturdy as an oak
I’m drinking whiskey and whiskey and whiskey and coke

[CHORUS]
A
Sometimes when I start drinking I hope it never ends
        E
I can’t help burning bottles like candles at both ends
  A
Tonight I’m fired up, let’s see where this all goes
    B7
One thing I know bout whiskey is it keeps you on your toes

(walk back to E)


We’re dancin’ and stomping cross that wooden floor
I went until I couldn’t, and then a little more
I’m hoping’, she’s as thirsty as looks
I’m drinking whiskey and whiskey, and whiskey and cokes

I ordered myself a double, and her a single too
She said I want what you’re drinking that’s why I’m here with you
I’m hoping, that’s not one big ugly hoax
We’re drinking whiskey an whiskey, and whiskey and cokes.

[CHORUS]

[INST]

We sat at that bar talking, for probably way too long
Stackin’ up the empties, and trading favorite songs
And hoping’, we weren’t embarrassing folks,
We kept drinkin' in whiskey and whiskey, and whiskey and cokes

We fell right off our barstools, like a couple English blokes
Or two tippy hippies, who had too many tokes
We’re hoping, to hide behind our liquor cloaks
We’re drinking whiskey an whiskey, and whiskey and cokes.

[CHORUS]

I came back from the bathroom, and she had gone away
Her friends had gathered her up, disappeared into the fray
I’m hoping, she’ll come back and tell more jokes
We can drink more whiskey and whiskey, and whiskey and cokes

I’m spinning’ on my barstool like a bicycle spoke
Tappin’ on my cigarette and blown’ out smoke
[end here?]
I’m hoping’ - that my tab won’t make me broke
Now I’m drinkin’ whiskey and whiskey, and whiskey and cokes
I’m drinkin’ whiskey and whiskey, and whiskey and cokes
