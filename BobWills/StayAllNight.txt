INTRO:
G and throw in the 3rd fret in 3 and 4 string


G
Can't go home if you're goin' by the mill
G                                    D7
Cause the bridge's washed out at the bottom of the hill
G
Big Creek's up Little Creek's level 
G                   D7
Plow my corn with a double shovel

[CHORUS]
G
Stay all night stay a little longer 
D7               G
Dance all night dance a little longer
G  
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner 
D7                      G
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

[inst]

Well you ought to see my blue eyed Sally 
She lives away down on Shinbone Alley
Number on the gate is the number on the door 
The next house over is the grocery store

[CHORUS]
[INST]

Sittin' in the window singin' to my love 
Slop bucket fell from the window above
Mule and the grasshopper eatin' ice cream 
Mule got sick so they laid him on the green

[CHORUS]
[CHORUS]

[OUT INST]
