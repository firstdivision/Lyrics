Capo 4

G
Cleaning out the darkest corners of my mind
       Bb                      C   
Taking all my full circles and making straight lines
     G
Been getting to the bottom of the bottom getting to me
     Bb                            C
Been holding up the mirror to everything I don't want to see
       Bb                     C                        G
But it ain't all flowers, sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
         Bb                      C                      G
When you play with the Devil you know you gonna get the horns


Been dancing with demons all my life
Every time I find my groove they cut in like a knife
Been a sin eater since I was born
Tired of feeling weighed down from carrying round all the pain that keeps me torn
So I pray when I lay me down to die
Grab a glass of wine and a seat to dine and go ahead and eat the whole damn pie

Major outro :)
