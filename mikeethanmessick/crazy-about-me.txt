crazy     about     me

fresh out of high school
we met at a stop light
I gave her a side glance
into the good night
we rode my old yamaha 
out to the concain
treated that Texas riverside
like it was Amsterdam

she's a twister
she's a live wire
she's a sister 
to a brushfire
yeah well she used to be
crazy about me

yea well that was good year
there was never a dull day
never your mind keels (kills?...no idea...)
some of them old folks say
you gotta sin to be saved
live to walk a straight line
I settled down some
and I bet she will some time
but until then

she's a twister
she's a live wire
she's a sister 
to a brushfire
yeah well she used to be
crazy about me
yeah well she used to be
crazy about me
