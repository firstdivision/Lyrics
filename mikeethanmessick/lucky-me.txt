D
Look at me me I've turned the page
          G       F#/G        Em
Look at me me I've closed the door
        A
Look at me I don't need you 
    D         [walk up to D]
any more

These are the things I would say
If I felt the urge to lie
but the one thing I can't tell you
      D         D7
is goodbye

                G
Yeah you should see thing you do
           D
You should hear the things you say
        D               Bm
if you stood here in my shoes
          G            Em
you would want to walk away
        D
I don't love you anymore
           Bm
that's not true
        Em
I still do
      A
lucky me I'll always be
             D        [walk up to D]
in love with you

Like a rock I stand my ground
like a fool I still believe
lack of hope I let you go
won't let me leave

Yeah these are the things
that make no sense
to anybody else
to anyone
less fortuynate than myself

Yeah you should see thing you do
You should hear the things you say
if you stood here in my shoes
you would want to walk away
I don't love you anymore
that's not true
I still do
lucky me I'll always be
in love with you
lucky me I'll always be
in love with you
