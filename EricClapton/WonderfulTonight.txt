G                   D/F#
   It's late in the evening
C                         D
   She's wondering what clothes to wear
G                  D/F#
   She puts on her make up
C                   D
   And brushes her long blonde hair
C               D
   And then she asks me
G       B   Em
   Do I look alright
              C             D           G     D/F#  C  D
   And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight

G           D/F#
   We go a party
C                D
   And everyone turns to see
G                 D/F#
   This beautiful lady
C                   D
   That's walking around with me
C               D
   And then she asks me
G         B   Em
   Do you feel alright
              C           D           G
   And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight

           C
   I feel wonderful
      D               G         B   Em
   Because I see the love light in your eyes
            C           D
   And the wonder of it all
                C             D
   Is that you just don't realize
               G        D/F#  C  D  G  D/F#  C  D
   How much I love you

G                   D/F#
   It's time to go home now
C                          D
   And I've got an aching head
G                     D/F#
   So I give her the car keys
C                   D
   She helps me to bed
C              D
   And then I tell her
G       B         Em
   As I turn out the light
             C                 D           G     B  Em Em/D
   I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
          C                 D           G   D/F#  C  D  G  D/F#  C  D  G
   Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight
