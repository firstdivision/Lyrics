[Chorus]
         F                 C     
Well I’m truckin trees for Christmas from 
B7                Am
this old mountain top 
     F                         C         
I’m trucking them down to the middle of 
          D                 G
town  to that big Christmas lot
         F                  C                         
Yeah I'm trucking trees for Christmas 

??
singing jiggle bells on my way

??
I’m trucking trees for Christmas  

??
for Christmas day

[/chorus]


Well you’ll find me trucking Christmas trees  
to town every year
and I feel like santa’s helper    
spreading a little good cheer

cause the kiddies have been waiting 
for this season all year long 
For Christmas trees and old Saint Nick  
to brighten up their home. 
                                                         
[Chorus]   

I got a string of pretty Christmas lights  a 
hanging from the cab of my truck                                                                                                             
And a little tree on my dashboard  that I’ve decorated up   

Well people may think I’m crazy  by these 
silly things I do  but I don’t care  cause I 
think the trucks like Christmas too 

[Chorus]
Yeah I’m trucking trees for Christmas for 
Christmas day
