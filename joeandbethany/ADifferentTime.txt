VERSE 1
C                                   Em
Mama says go out and play
              C
until the sun goes down
                           Em
at the end of the day
              C
Rip your jeans, stain your shirt
           Em
build a fort, move the dirt
                      Am
but don't you play too safe
                  D            Em
just so you don't get hurt


(repeat for second verse)


CHORUS 1
             C                            G
It was a different time back then
               C                                         G
when the world was kind and I could understand
   C                              G
a simple life without a bigger plan
             Am         D             Em
it was a different time back then

it was a different time back then

it was a different time back then
