         G
All the years I

        G
Lost to sadness

            C
And all the years I

        G
Lost to rage


       G
Like a dog that

           G
bites it's master

F#         Em
  Have you rattled 

         D
At your cage


                c                D
And all the the words you left unspoken

         G                     C
Gathered round your brain, to grieve


            G
Around this lonely
        G
Fading picture

F#       Em
 Of the man you
 
         D
Couldn't be


 C            G
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

  C          G    D/F#      G
OhhhhhhhhhhhhOhhhhOh


        G
When we reach our
 
        G
Proper station

         C
Will we have to 

           G
shield our eyes



         G
From the background

    G
Radiation

F#     Em
  Underneath these

       D/F#
Silent skies


           C                D
Or live as dust beneath the alter so

      G           C
Forgotten and discrete


         G
With no chance to

     G
Ever falter

F#   Em
Underneath your 

         D/F#
Savior's feet

 
   C/G        G
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 
   C/G    G    D/F#
OhhhhgghhhhOhhhOhh

   C/G        G
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

   C/G    G    D/F#
OhhhhgghhhhOhhhOhh


 
              G
And we're convinced that

          G
There's a cadence

       C
To the murmors

       G
In the dark


            G
Wrapped in patient

    G
Arbitration

    F#      Em
between our weary

          D/F#
Head and heart


           C                    D
Until our spirits cease their raging

        G                 C
In the silence of the night


         G
We will look for

          G
Love and logic

F#        Em
  In the dying

        D
Of the light


   C/G         G
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

   C/G    G    D/F#
OhhhhgghhhhOhhhOhh

   C/G        G
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

   C/G    G    D/F#
OhhhhgghhhhOhhhOhh

   C/G        G
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

   C/G    G    D/F#
OhhhhgghhhhOhhhOhh
