(Verse)
Well I (G) had a buddy back in (C)81 
And we (G)made ourselves a pact
(G) We were headin for the (C)new pipeline 
And we were (D) never coming back
We (G)worked 80 hours making (C)time and a half 
But La (G)Grange was too damn hot
So we (G)drove back home home at the (C)end of that week 
And (D)we spent it all on (G)pot

(Chorus)
So I'll see you in (G)Houston if I (C)ever get out that way 
I'll see you in (G)Dallas but I (D)won't have long to stay
If your ever out (G)west son and your (C)feeling like  slowin' down 
I'll see you a-(G)round round (D)my home-(G)-town (C) (G) (D) (G) (D)

(Verse)
Well I (G) played ball every (C)single fall
I could (G)run just like the wind
(G) I went to college like they (C) asked me to
But they (D) didn't ask my friends
(G) Don't think I've seen a (C)single classroom 
But I (G) drank a lot of beer
(G) My buddies still love to (C)listen to me 
When I (D)talk about that (G)year

(Chorus)
So I'll see you in (G)Houston if I (C)ever get out that way 
I'll see you in (G)Dallas but I (D)won't have long to stay 
If your ever out (G)west son and your (C)feeling like slowin' down 
I'll see you a-(G)round round (D)my home-(G)-town

(Verse)
Now I (G) got myself a (C)little band and (G)we're pretty good I guess
But I (G) never learned how to (C)wear my hair 
And I (D)never learned how to dress
(G) So I'm leavin' for the (C)last time honey 
Iâ€™m (G) never more to roam
Gonna (G)pack my bags a little (C)heavy this time 
Gonna (D)head my ass back home (G)

(Chorus)
So I'll see you in (G)Nashville if I (C)ever get out that way
I'll see you in (G)Austin but I (D)won't have long to stay
If you're ever out (G)west son and you're (C)feelin' like slowin' down
I'll see you a-(G)round round (D)my home-(G)-town (C)
I'll see you a-(G)round round (D)my home-(G)-town
