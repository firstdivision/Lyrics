Pull Away
----------------------------

     E             B
It's comin down in buckets
         E            B
You were comin' on to strong
    E       B
Somewhere I wound up 
          D#7           G#M
no longer able to play along

         E          B
You got lost in the moment
              E               B
What you were feeling was for real
E                    B
Lost control of your emotions
         D#7                 G#m
Yeah you gave me a few good scares

         E
I had to pull away
       B  
And it hurts me to hear you cry
         E
And baby someday
         F#
He'll be holdin' you in his arms

      E          B
Sweet blond and pretty
        E               B
She had everything you needed
        E         A
Comin' out of the last one
       D#7
It got ugly and y'all got heated

When you finally realized
What you had in your hands
She was already movin' on
To a better lovin' man

She had to pull away
And it hurts me to see you sad
And buddy someday
He'll be holdin' her in his arms

B          E
Love's no longer
B              E
Singin' in the rain
     B           E
It's a world of sufferin'
         D#7                G#m
A lot of hearts are feelin' pain
E          B
So confusin'
        E                    B           
I don't think we'll ever understand
      E                  B
Why sometimes a'int just meant to be
          D#7          G#m        
between a woman and a man

[inst]

It's not for me to say
Lord only knows I've tried
The only thing I can count on is 
a broken heart and mixed up feelins'

Always the best of friends
With the ones that we can't have
Never seemed to make much send
Why two buddies can't be in love.
