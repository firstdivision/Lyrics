It Wasn't Me
--------------------------------------


D     
Whatever happened to just 
                         G
lovin' straight from the heart
D                                            
Comin' out of the gate with 
                  G
everything you've got

I wear my heart on my sleeve and I gave it to you
Two broken puzzle pieces and now we're through


A             G
We all make mistakes
      A       G
It's easy to do
A                       G
Feelings sometimes can confuse
       A
What's right and wrong 
              G
and who is to blame
                 D
I hope is wasn't me

So when you came runnin' into my life with him
I took the good with bad and was ready to begin

Seems that I gave more than I had to give
Still I never expected it to end like this

There's an empty piece of my heart
That hurts for something 
that was wrong from the start
I hope you find what you need
I'm sorry it wasn't me

Solitude is the only thing I need
And I can feel you pushing away from me
Baby, don't deny
Who the love is for that you have inside
I'm sorry it wasn't me
