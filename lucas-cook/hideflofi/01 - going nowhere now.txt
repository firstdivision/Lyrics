Going Nowhere Now
------------------------------

Capo on 1

A - A/C# - A/D


When you're down and out
And you try so hard
Try to get your grip
Just to make it through

I will always know how you feel

When your world is dark
You can't find the light
feel the heavy weight 
Of a bitter world

I will always know how you feel
Going nowhere now

When your life slows down
And all becomes clear
See a lonely picture
Looking in the mirror

I will always know how you feel

When the pain has passed
And you're free again
Shed those chains at last
And let love come in

I will always know how you feel
Going nowhere now

When you're looking back
On the path you've paved
Going nowhere now
And your life has changed

I will always know how you feel

When the circumstance 
Seems to make no sense
Cause you took the chance
Rage comes rushing in

I will always know how you feel
Going nowhere now.
