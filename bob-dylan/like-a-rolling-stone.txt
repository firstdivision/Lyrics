[Verse 1]
D                    Em
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
    F#m                   G             A
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,   didnâ€™t you?
D                      Em
People'd call, say, "Beware doll,
       F#m                        G             A
you're bound to fall" You thought they were all   a kiddin' you

G             A
  You used to   laugh about
G                    A
  Everybody that was   hangin' out

G         F#m   Em          D
 Now you don't talk so loud
G         F#m   Em           D
 Now you don't seem so proud
     Em                       G           A
About having to be scrounging   your next meal

[Chorus]
                D  G  A
How does it feel
                D  G  A
How does it feel
                    D  G  A
To be without a home
                       D  G  A
Like a complete unknown
                     D  G  A
Like a rolling stone

[Instrumental]
D  G  A

[Verse 2]
           D            Em
Aww, You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
        F#m                         G           A
But you know you only used to get   juiced in it
  D                        Em
Nobody has ever taught you how to live out on the street
               F#m                G           A
And now you're gonna have to get   used to it

G                    A
  You said you'd never  compromise
G                                    A
  With the mystery tramp, but now you  realize

G         F#m        Em     D
 He's not selling any  alibis
G                      F#m     Em       D
 As you stare into the vacuum  of his eyes
    Em                G        A
And say do you want to  make a deal?

[Chorus]
                D  G  A
How does it feel
                D  G  A
How does it feel
                 D  G  A
To be on your own
                      D  G  A
With no direction home
                  D  G  A
A complete unknown
                    D  G  A
Like a rolling stone

[Instrumental]
D  G  A


[Verse]
Aww, You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did   tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your   kicks for you
 
  You used to ride on the chrome horse with your   diplomat
  Who carried on his shoulder a   Siamese cat
 
 Ain't it hard  when you discover that
 He really wasn't  where it's at
After he took from you everything  he could steal
 
[Chorus]
How does it feel
How does it feel
To have you on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
 
[Instrumental]
 
[Verse]
Aww, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they   got it made
 Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
 
  You used to be so amused
  At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
 
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
 When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
 
[Chorus]
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
 
[Instrumental]
