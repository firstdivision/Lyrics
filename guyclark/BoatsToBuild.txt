C               F
It's time for a change 
C                 F                 G                       
I'm tired of that same old same the same old words
Am                 Bb                          G
the same old lines the same old tricks and the same old rhymes 
C             F    C               F
Days precious days roll in and out like waves 
G                          Am
I got boards to bend I got planks to nail 
      Bb                    G
I got charts to make I got seas to sail 
          F                     G
I'm gonna build me a boat with these two hands 
           C                 F
It'll be a fair curve from a noble plan 
Dm                 G
let the chips fall where they will cause 
         C              G  Am   F    C    G    C
I've got boats to build 
C                   F
Sails are just like wings 
    C        F            G 
The wind can make em sing songs of life 
Am            Bb                 G
Songs of hope songs to keep your dreams afloat 
          F                    G
I'm gonna build me a boat with these two hands 
           C                 F
It'll be a fair curve from a noble plan 
Dm                 G
Let the chips fall where they will cause 
         C              G  Am   F    C    G    C
I've got boats to build 
C              F
Shores distant shores 
C 
There's where 
    F
I'm headed for 
G                 Am
Got the stars to guide my way
Bb            G
sail into the light of day 
          F                    G
I'm gonna build me a boat with these two hands 
           C                 F
It'll be a fair curve from a noble plan 
Dm                 G
let the chips fall where they will cause 
         C              G  Am   F    C    G    C
I've got boats to build
