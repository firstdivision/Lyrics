Yarn - This is The Year

VERSE: G - C - G - G - D - G
CHORUS: C - G - C - D


This is the year
We're gonna make that change
This is the year
we start all over again

This is the year 
we're all gonna come out winning
we're gonna raise a glass
to a new beginning

[chorus]
And we'll let go
with all the anger we hold
and we'll let fall 
all the tears

Oh this is the year
We're gonna make that change
This is the year
We're gonna find our way

 Em     C              G
All the hardships and pain
Em          C             G
    No they don't have to be
Em         C           G
   And it don't mean a Goddamn thing
      Em            D            G
If it don't, if you don't let it.

This is the year
We're gonna make that change
This is the year
we start all over again

This is the year
We're all gonna come out swinnging
We're gonna raise a glass 
to a new beginning

[solo]

And we'll let go
with all the anger we hold
and we'll let fall 
all the tears

Oh this is the year
We're gonna make that change
This is the year
We're gonna find our way

Oh this is the year
We're gonna make that change
This is the year
We're gonna find our way
