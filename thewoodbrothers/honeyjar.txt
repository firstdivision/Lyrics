Standin’ on the back of that train with your open arms

looking art the big sky listening’ to the smoke alarms

You wonder what happened well your heart must have jumped the track

You put your lips out in the wind and you hope you get some kissing back


Every night night you got the same old dream

There’s a spoon full of honey where your heart should be

And there’s a honey dripping’ off of your spoon

honey dripping’ off of your spoon

honey dripping’ off of your spoon

honey dripping’ off of your spoon


Yeah white skin, freckles, big heart, candy green eyes,

I bet you wish you had your red-headed woman back some times,

Yeeeaah last thing you got was a left-handed letter

And you opened up the seal like you didn’t even know better


Every night night you got the same old dream

There’s a spoon fulll of honey where your heart should be

And there’s a honey dripping’ off of your spoon

honey dripping’ off of your spoon

honey dripping’ off of your spoon

honey dripping’ off of your spoon

Don’t you know, the spoon’s getting low

You worry and you wonder just where all the honey go

then you’re you’re hopin’ and you’re praying’ real hard

if you will it you can can wish it

Happy as a honey jaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
