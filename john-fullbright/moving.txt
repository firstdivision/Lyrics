[Verse 1]
C                                            F  C
Old man broke down on the side of the road
C                                            F  C
Stop and see if maybe I can lighten his load
C                                            F  C
Well he opened the door and he thanked me in kind
C                                            F  C
Told me the words that would open my mind

[Chorus]
(He said)
C
Don’t worry about gasoline cuz
       F   C
We’re moving
C
Don’t worry about the TV screen cuz
       F   C
We’re moving
C
Don’t worry about the bombs that fall cuz
       F   C
We’re moving
C
Don’t worry about nothing at all cuz
F   C
We’re moving

[Verse 2]
C                                                    F  C
There’s a man in the alley just a’singing the blues
C                                            F  C
Telling everybody that they’re born to lose
C                                            F  C
Well one day he’ll wake up and see the sun
C                                                     F  C
See that everyday we’re breathing is a day we’ve won


[Chorus]
C
Don’t worry about gasoline cuz
       F   C
We’re moving
C
Don’t worry about the TV screen cuz

We’re moving
C
Don’t worry about the bombs that fall cuz
       F   C
We’re movin
C
Don’t worry about nothing at all cuz
 F   C

[Bridge]
G
There’s times the lines get hard to see
F
And there’s days the haze takes over me
C
But in the end you’re gonna grit your teeth
          F   C
And keep moving

C                                                         F  C
Well the world will keep turning when I’m dead and gone
C                                            F  C
I’ll see you again and it won’t be too long
C                                                      F  C
Maybe we’ll meet in a place where there ain’t no pain
C                                            F  C
Until that day my song remains

[Chorus]
