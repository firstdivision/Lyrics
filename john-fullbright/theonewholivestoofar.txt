C         G                Am    Am/G
I haven’t told myself the truth 
F                                  C   G
    Since the first night you were gone
C              G                 Am
  I’d like to think I was living easy
      Dm             F          C
That love was mostly living all alone


C              G               Am    Am/G
Maybe its the wind blowing us together
F                                  C  G
    Maybe its the world blowing me away
C            G                  Am
   Maybe the tall trees bow down before us
Dm                 F               C
    Pleading for a lonely heart to stay


[Chorus]
F                                      C
Truth be told the odds are stacked against us

E                              Am    Am/G
Truth be told they often always are

F  
Unless you really care about me

C        G     F
Don’t go up the stairs without

    C                E
The boy that let you drive him in

     Am      Am/G      F
your mother’s beat up car

      G7
Don’t forget the one that lives too far


Some folks make something out of nothing
Some people have to cry too long
While others wait beside the window
Wondering why the wind would blow so strong

Now I’ll admit I’m feeling cold and naked
Just like I’m standing in the rain
With nothing left out here to hide behind
And I wonder if you feel the same.

[chorus]
